 The transformations have in common that they read each line of the input image, apply a transformation rule to each pixel value, and write the transformed pixel values to the corresponding position in the output image. The width and height are determined by the number of pixels in the first line of the input image.

To compute the width, we simply take the length of the first line. To compute the height, we take the number of lines in the input image. In this case, since it is a PGM image with a header, the number of lines is given by the second value in the header (after the magic number "P5" or "P2").

For Transformation D - Output, the transformation rule is to subtract 1 from each pixel value and then swap the values of the first and second pixels. So for a line like `8 3`, the transformed line would be `3 8`. Therefore, the output image should have the following format:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
<number_of_lines>
<line_1_transformed>
<line_2_transformed>
...
<line_n_transformed>
```

So, for the given input image:

```pgm
P2
# input
2 1
9
8 3
```

The width is 2 and the height is 1 (since it's a single line image). The transformed first line would be `3 8`. Therefore, the output image should look like:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
<number_of_lines>
3 8
```

Since there is only one line in the input image, `<number_of_lines>` would be 1. So the final output image should look like:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
1
3 8
```

Correct!
