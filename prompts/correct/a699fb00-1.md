I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):1,(2,0):1,(1,3):1,(3,3):1}
output[0] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):1,(1,0):2,(2,0):1,(1,3):1,(2,3):2,(3,3):1}

input[1] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,1):1,(3,1):1,(5,1):1,(7,1):1,(2,4):1,(4,4):1,(6,6):1,(8,6):1,(3,8):1,(5,8):1}
output[1] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,1):1,(2,1):2,(3,1):1,(4,1):2,(5,1):1,(6,1):2,(7,1):1,(2,4):1,(3,4):2,(4,4):1,(6,6):1,(7,6):2,(8,6):1,(3,8):1,(4,8):2,(5,8):1}

input[2] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(6,1):1,(8,1):1,(1,2):1,(3,2):1,(3,5):1,(5,5):1,(7,5):1,(4,7):1,(6,7):1,(1,9):1,(3,9):1}
output[2] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(6,1):1,(7,1):2,(8,1):1,(1,2):1,(2,2):2,(3,2):1,(3,5):1,(4,5):2,(5,5):1,(6,5):2,(7,5):1,(4,7):1,(5,7):2,(6,7):1,(1,9):1,(2,9):2,(3,9):1}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[3] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,0):1,(3,0):1,(2,2):1,(4,2):1,(6,2):1,(8,2):1,(1,4):1,(3,4):1,(5,5):1,(7,5):1,(3,7):1,(5,7):1}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[3] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
The patterns observed indicate that each coordinate with a value of 1 in the input has its adjacent pixel on the right, if not already present, set to a value of 2 in the output. This transformation does not apply to pixels located at the rightmost edge of the image. This results in the output never being the same as the input.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mass of each layer | Varies | The mass of each layer depends on the number of coordinates with value 1 or 2. |
| Strongly connected clusters | Varies | The number of strongly connected clusters varies depending on the arrangement of coordinates. |
| Mass related to sorting of layers | No | The mass of each layer does not seem to affect the sorting of layers. |
| Isolated pixels | Yes | Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of the same layer sometimes change layer. |
| Horizontal lines | No | There are no horizontal lines extending from edge to edge. |
| Vertical lines | No | There are no vertical lines extending from edge to edge. |
| Filled rectangles | No | There are no filled rectangles. |
| Hollow boxes | No | There are no hollow boxes. |
| L-shapes | No | There are no L-shapes. |
| T-shapes | No | There are no T-shapes. |
| H-shapes | No | There are no H-shapes. |
| E-shapes | No | There are no E-shapes. |
| Plus-shapes | No | There are no Plus-shapes. |
| Tetris-shapes | No | There are no Tetris-shapes. |
| Other shapes | No | There are no other distinguishable shapes. |
| Line connecting landmarks | No | There is no line connecting landmarks. |
| Shape changing layer | Yes | Shapes (pixels) change layer but preserve their shape. It's triggered when the pixel has no pixel to its right. |
| Shape moving x, y | No | Shapes do not move along the x, y axis. |
| Boolean operations | No | There are no evident Boolean operations. |

# Task C
The action that converts input to output is to add a pixel with a value of 2 to the right of each pixel with a value of 1, provided there is no pixel already present at that location and it is not the rightmost edge of the image.

# Task D
Following the same pattern, we would add a pixel with value 2 to the right of each pixel with value 1 from the input, except when it is on the rightmost edge of the image.

```python
output[3] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,0):1,(2,0):2,(3,0):1,(2,2):1,(3,2):2,(4,2):1,(5,2):2,(6,2):1,(7,2):2,(8,2):1,(1,4):1,(2,4):2,(3,4):1,(5,5):1,(6,5):2,(7,5):1,(3,7):1,(4,7):2,(5,7):1}
