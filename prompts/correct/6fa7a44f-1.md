I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):9,(1,0):1,(2,0):4,(0,1):9,(1,1):1,(2,1):4,(0,2):2,(1,2):1,(2,2):1}
output[0] = {'width':3,'height':6,(0,0):9,(1,0):1,(2,0):4,(0,1):9,(1,1):1,(2,1):4,(0,2):2,(1,2):1,(2,2):1,(0,3):2,(1,3):1,(2,3):1,(0,4):9,(1,4):1,(2,4):4,(0,5):9,(1,5):1,(2,5):4}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):4,(1,0):8,(2,0):4,(0,1):7,(1,1):6,(2,1):7,(0,2):8,(1,2):7,(2,2):8}
output[1] = {'width':3,'height':6,(0,0):4,(1,0):8,(2,0):4,(0,1):7,(1,1):6,(2,1):7,(0,2):8,(1,2):7,(2,2):8,(0,3):8,(1,3):7,(2,3):8,(0,4):7,(1,4):6,(2,4):7,(0,5):4,(1,5):8,(2,5):4}

input[2] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):7,(1,0):7,(2,0):7,(0,1):9,(1,1):5,(2,1):5,(0,2):5,(1,2):1,(2,2):7}
output[2] = {'width':3,'height':6,(0,0):7,(1,0):7,(2,0):7,(0,1):9,(1,1):5,(2,1):5,(0,2):5,(1,2):1,(2,2):7,(0,3):5,(1,3):1,(2,3):7,(0,4):9,(1,4):5,(2,4):5,(0,5):7,(1,5):7,(2,5):7}

input[3] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):6,(2,0):9,(0,1):2,(1,1):6,(2,1):9,(0,2):2,(1,2):9,(2,2):2}
output[3] = {'width':3,'height':6,(0,0):2,(1,0):6,(2,0):9,(0,1):2,(1,1):6,(2,1):9,(0,2):2,(1,2):9,(2,2):2,(0,3):2,(1,3):9,(2,3):2,(0,4):2,(1,4):6,(2,4):9,(0,5):2,(1,5):6,(2,5):9}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.
- Are the output images symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[4] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):9,(2,0):2,(0,1):8,(1,1):5,(2,1):2,(0,2):2,(1,2):2,(2,2):8}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[4] = PREDICT
```

# Task A

1. The input images are always 3x3 grids and the output images are 3x6 grids.
2. The output image is a mirror image of the input along the X-axis.
3. The output is not a cropped area from the input, as the input doesn't have enough area to produce the output.
4. The output isn't similar to the input when rotated.
5. The output isn't similar to the input when flipped along the Y-axis, but is a mirror image when flipped along the X-axis.
6. The output isn't similar to the input when diagonally flipped.
7. The output images are symmetric around the x-axis, but not around the y-axis.

# Task B

| Observation Name   | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation   |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Image Dimensions   | Input: 3x3, Output: 3x6 | Width remains the same while height doubles in the output images. |
| Image Symmetry     | X-axis symmetry: Yes, Y-axis symmetry: No | The output images are symmetric around the x-axis but not the y-axis. |
| Image Mirroring    | X-axis mirroring: Yes, Y-axis mirroring: No | The output images mirror the input image along the x-axis. |
| Shapes and Patterns| No specific shapes found | No specific shapes or patterns, like L, T, H, E, Plus, Tetris shapes are found. Also, no line or stripe patterns are observed. |

# Task C

The action that converts the input to the output is:
- The input image is mirrored along the x-axis (horizontal axis).

# Task D

For the provided input, mirroring it along the x-axis should yield the correct output.

```python
output[4] = {'width':3,'height':6,(0,0):2,(1,0):9,(2,0):2,(0,1):8,(1,1):5,(2,1):2,(0,2):2,(1,2):2,(2,2):8,
(0,3):2,(1,3):2,(2,3):8,(0,4):8,(1,4):5,(2,4):2,(0,5):2,(1,5):9,(2,5):2}
```
