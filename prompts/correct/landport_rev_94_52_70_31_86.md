# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation E - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution.

 The transformations share the following properties: they preserve the first line, which consists of two integers representing the width and height of the image; they rearrange the pixels in a specific order.

To compute the width and height from the input PGM file, we simply read the first two numbers in the file. The width is the first number, and the height is the second number.

For Transformation E - Output:

1. Since the first line (width and height) remains unchanged, it's 2 1 and 9 respectively.
2. The pixels are sorted based on their row index in ascending order.
3. For each row, the pixels are swapped with the pixel at the same column index but in the previous row.
4. So, the output will be:

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
6 8
```

Correct!
