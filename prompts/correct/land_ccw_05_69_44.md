# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation C - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A, B, and C, the input PGM files have a fixed width of 2 pixels and a variable height. The first line specifies the number of rows (height) and columns (width).

To compute the width, we read the first line and extract the second value. For example, in Transformation A, the width is 2.

In Transformation C - Output, the input has a width of 2 pixels and a height of 2 rows. The output should be:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
4
4
```

Correct!
