I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(1,0):5,(0,1):5,(1,1):5,(2,1):2}
output[0] = {'width':6,'height':3,'background':0,(1,0):5,(4,0):5,(0,1):5,(1,1):5,(2,1):2,(3,1):5,(4,1):5,(5,1):2}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':4,'background':0,(0,0):3,(0,1):2,(1,1):3,(0,2):2,(1,2):1,(2,2):8,(1,3):1}
output[1] = {'width':6,'height':4,'background':0,(0,0):3,(3,0):3,(0,1):2,(1,1):3,(3,1):2,(4,1):3,(0,2):2,(1,2):1,(2,2):8,(3,2):2,(4,2):1,(5,2):8,(1,3):1,(4,3):1}

input[2] = {'width':4,'height':4,'background':0,(0,0):5,(1,0):2,(2,0):3,(0,1):2,(1,1):5,(2,1):3,(0,2):5,(1,2):2,(2,2):8,(3,2):8,(2,3):6}
output[2] = {'width':8,'height':4,'background':0,(0,0):5,(1,0):2,(2,0):3,(4,0):5,(5,0):2,(6,0):3,(0,1):2,(1,1):5,(2,1):3,(4,1):2,(5,1):5,(6,1):3,(0,2):5,(1,2):2,(2,2):8,(3,2):8,(4,2):5,(5,2):2,(6,2):8,(7,2):8,(2,3):6,(6,3):6}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[3] = {'width':4,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):4,(0,1):4,(1,1):5,(1,2):5,(2,2):6,(0,3):6,(1,3):6,(2,3):1,(3,4):1}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[3] = PREDICT
```

---

# Task A

- The output images are twice as wide as the input images.
- The pixel patterns in the input image are duplicated in the output image and shifted right.
- The duplicate pattern appears at the center of the output image.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments About the Observation |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Image Width      | Double of input image's width | Every output image's width is twice that of the input image |
| Pattern Duplication | Yes | The patterns formed by the pixels in the input image are duplicated in the output image |
| Pixel Shift | Right shift | The duplicated pattern is shifted to the right |
| Isolated Pixels | Yes | If a pixel in the input image doesn't have an adjacent pixel of the same layer, its layer is unchanged in the output |
| Shapes | N/A | There are no distinct shapes observed in the inputs or outputs. |

# Task C

To convert the input to the output:
- Duplicate the input pattern
- Shift the duplicate pattern to the right by the width of the input image
- Merge the original pattern and the shifted pattern.

# Task D

In this input example, the output will be created by duplicating the input image and shifting it to the right by the width of the input image (4 units in this case). The resulting image will be twice as wide, with two copies of the original image, one offset to the right.

Here is the predicted output:

```python
output[3] = {'width':8,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):4,(4,0):4,(0,1):4,(4,1):4,(1,1):5,(5,1):5,(1,2):5,(5,2):5,(2,2):6,(6,2):6,(0,3):6,(4,3):6,(1,3):6,(5,3):6,(2,3):1,(6,3):1,(3,4):1,(7,4):1}
```
