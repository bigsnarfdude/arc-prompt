 In Transformations A-C, the input PGM file has a fixed width of 2 pixels and variable height. The output PGM files have a width equal to the number of columns in the input (first number) and a height equal to the number of rows in the input (second number).

The transformation involves rearranging the pixel values in each row, with the first value remaining unchanged while the second value is moved to the end.

To compute width and height from the input PGM file:
1. Read the first two numbers as width and height.
2. Use these values for the output PGM file.

For Transformation D - Output, the solution would be:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
1
5
```

Correct!
