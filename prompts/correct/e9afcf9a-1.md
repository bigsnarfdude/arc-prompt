I'm doing CPP experiments.


These are run-length encoded images.
The RLE used here only uses black and white. There are no other colors than black or white. Example `B3W7B2` becomes `3 black, 7 white, 2 black`.

The ID indicates the layer number. Multiple images can be stacked and black can be considered transparent.


```cpp
input[0] = "width6:height2:ID3:6W 6B:ID9:6B 6W";
output[0] = "width6:height2:ID3:1W1B1W1B1W1B 1B1W1B1W1B1W:ID9:1B1W1B1W1B1W 1W1B1W1B1W1B";

input[1] = "width6:height2:ID4:6W 6B:ID8:6B 6W";
output[1] = "width6:height2:ID4:1W1B1W1B1W1B 1B1W1B1W1B1W:ID8:1B1W1B1W1B1W 1W1B1W1B1W1B";
```

# Task A
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.


# Task B
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```cpp
input[2] = "width6:height2:ID2:6B 6W:ID6:6W 6B";
```
Print your reasoning before printing the output code.

Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.
Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```cpp
output[2] = "width6:height2:PREDICT";
```

To answer both tasks, we first need to analyze the given information and examples, and understand the transformations happening on the input strings to generate the output strings.

For Task A, we have to calculate the 'mass' of each layer and understand if it has any impact on the sorting of layers. 

The 'mass' of each layer appears to be the total count of all black (B) and white (W) in that layer. 

Looking at the given examples, the mass for both layers (ID3 and ID9 in the first example, and ID4 and ID8 in the second example) is the same, which is 12 (6B + 6W or 6W + 6B). It seems that the mass has no direct effect on the sorting of layers, because layers are sorted based on their IDs (i.e., layer ID3 comes before layer ID9, and layer ID4 comes before layer ID8).

For Task B, we have to predict the output for the given input. Looking at the examples, we can observe a pattern. It seems that each string of continuous black or white pixels (indicated by '6W' or '6B') in the input has been converted into alternating black and white pixels in the output (1W1B1W1B1W1B or 1B1W1B1W1B1W). Also, the order of the layers is preserved, with the layer having smaller ID coming before the layer with larger ID.

Applying these transformations to the given input for Task B, we get:

```cpp
output[2] = "width6:height2:ID2:1B1W1B1W1B1W 1W1B1W1B1W1B:ID6:1W1B1W1B1W1B 1B1W1B1W1B1W";
```
