I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':9,'height':9,'background':0,(6,1):5,(3,4):5,(1,7):5}
output[0] = {'width':9,'height':9,'background':0,(5,0):1,(6,0):1,(7,0):1,(5,1):1,(6,1):5,(7,1):1,(5,2):1,(6,2):1,(7,2):1,(2,3):1,(3,3):1,(4,3):1,(2,4):1,(3,4):5,(4,4):1,(2,5):1,(3,5):1,(4,5):1,(0,6):1,(1,6):1,(2,6):1,(0,7):1,(1,7):5,(2,7):1,(0,8):1,(1,8):1,(2,8):1}

input[1] = {'width':9,'height':9,'background':0,(7,1):5,(3,2):5,(7,5):5,(3,7):5}
output[1] = {'width':9,'height':9,'background':0,(6,0):1,(7,0):1,(8,0):1,(2,1):1,(3,1):1,(4,1):1,(6,1):1,(7,1):5,(8,1):1,(2,2):1,(3,2):5,(4,2):1,(6,2):1,(7,2):1,(8,2):1,(2,3):1,(3,3):1,(4,3):1,(6,4):1,(7,4):1,(8,4):1,(6,5):1,(7,5):5,(8,5):1,(2,6):1,(3,6):1,(4,6):1,(6,6):1,(7,6):1,(8,6):1,(2,7):1,(3,7):5,(4,7):1,(2,8):1,(3,8):1,(4,8):1}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[2] = {'width':9,'height':9,'background':0,(1,1):5,(7,2):5,(3,4):5,(1,7):5,(5,7):5}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[2] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
In the provided examples, each 5 in the input appears surrounded by 1's in the output. Each 5 in the input seems to trigger a 3x3 square with a 5 in the center and 1's around it in the output, but only if there's enough space on the grid. 

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mass of each layer | Varies | The mass of each layer depends on the number of 5's in the input and the available space around them in the grid. |
| Strongly connected clusters | 1 per 5 in input | Each 5 in the input creates a single cluster in the output. |
| Mass related to sorting of layers | No | The mass doesn't seem to affect the ordering of layers. |
| Isolated pixels | Yes | Isolated pixels turn into clusters. |
| Horizontal/Vertical lines | No | There are no clear horizontal or vertical lines. |
| Filled rectangles | No | No filled rectangles. |
| Hollow boxes | No | No hollow boxes. |
| L-shapes, T-shapes, H-shapes, E-shapes | No | None of these shapes are observed. |
| Plus-shapes | Yes | The clusters formed around 5's are plus-shaped. |
| Tetris-shapes | No | No Tetris shapes observed. |
| Line connecting two landmarks | No | No clear lines connecting landmarks. |
| Shape change layer | No | No clear pattern of shapes changing layers. |
| Shape move relative x,y | Yes | The location of 5's from the input determines the location of clusters in the output. |
| Boolean operations | No | No clear boolean operations observed. |

# Task C
To convert the input to output, for each coordinate with a value of 5, a 3x3 square is created in the output around this coordinate, with the center being the original 5 and the surrounding pixels being 1, provided there is enough space in the grid.

# Task D

Given the pattern observed, each coordinate in the input with a value of 5 will generate a 3x3 square in the output, centered on this coordinate. The output square will have a 5 in the center and 1's surrounding it.

```python
output[2] = {'width':9,'height':9,'background':0,(0,0):1,(1,0):1,(2,0):1,(0,1):1,(1,1):5,(2,1):1,(0,2):1,(1,2):1,(2,2):1,(6,1):1,(7,1):1,(8,1):1,(6,2):1,(7,2):5,(8,2):1,(6,3):1,(7,3):1,(8,3):1,(2,3):1,(3,3):1,(4,3):1,(2,4):1,(3,4):5,(4,4):1,(2,5):1,(3,5):1,(4,5):1,(0,6):1,(1,6):1,(2,6):1,(0,7):1,(1,7):5,(2,7):1,(0,8):1,(1,8):1,(2,8):1,(4,6):1,(5,6):1,(6,6):1,(4,7):1,(5,7):5,(6,7):1,(4,8):1,(5,8):1,(6,8):1}
```
