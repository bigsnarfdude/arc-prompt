# Task

This task is completed when the subtasks have been completed.

Fill in your answer into the `Answer Template`.

## Subtask A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common, like abstraction and reasoning. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

## Subtask B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

## Subtask C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

## Subtask A: Analysis
The transformations have a pattern of swapping the first two numbers in each line, while keeping the rest of the numbers in the same order. This can be seen by comparing the input and output for each transformation.
To compute the width and height, we count the number of numbers in the first line of the PGM format. In this case, there are 2 numbers in the first line, so the width is 2 and the height is also 2.
## Subtask B: Solution
To solve `Transformation D - Output`, we need to apply the same pattern as in the other transformations. This means swapping the first two numbers in each line of the input PGM format.
Given the input:
```pgm
P2
# input
1 2
9
3
1
```
The output will be:
```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
1 3
```
## Subtask C: Verify
To verify the solution, we can compare it to the expected output. In this case, the expected output is not provided, so we cannot verify the solution directly. However, based on the pattern observed in the other transformations, the solution seems reasonable.
