I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width6_height9
object(input4_idP48kmo7_t4_l1_b4_r6_w6_h1_m6_shapeRectangle_scalex6_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input4_idP33ffe7_t1_l3_b2_r4_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(input4_idPfe7a8k_t6_l1_b7_r2_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).

% Example 4 output grid_width2_height2
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output4_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A

The output objects from all the examples have the following common properties:

1. They all retain the 'Rectangle' shape.
2. They have preserved the 'm' prefix value (mass), which is 4 for all the output objects.
3. They all have the same dimensions with a width (w) of 2 and a height (h) of 2.
4. They are all placed at the top left corner of the grid with their top left coordinates at (t=1, l=1) and bottom right coordinates at (b=2, r=2).

The objects are not necessarily sorted in any particular way because each output only contains one object. However, the selected object for the output seems to be the one with the smallest Euclidean or Manhattan distance from the top left corner of the grid (t=1, l=1) in the input.

# Task B

The transformations from the input to the output across all the examples seem to follow the following steps:

1. **Selection**: An object is selected based on its proximity to the top left corner of the grid (t=1, l=1) in the input. The object with the smallest Euclidean or Manhattan distance from this point is chosen.

2. **Preservation**: The chosen object's mass (m prefix) and shape (Rectangle) are preserved.

3. **Positioning**: The chosen object is repositioned at the top left corner of the grid in the output. This involves updating its 't', 'l', 'b', and 'r' coordinates.

4. **Resizing**: The grid size is changed to match the dimensions of the chosen object, which is always a 2x2 rectangle.

No new objects are inserted in these transformations. Objects that are not chosen based on the selection criteria are deleted. 

# Task C

Given the consistent 2x2 size and top-left positioning of the output objects in all examples, the current orientation seems to be the most appropriate. The objects are already laid out in the top-left direction. However, if we wanted to change the layout direction to, for example, bottom-right, we would have to update the object's 't', 'l', 'b', 'r' coordinates as well as the grid size accordingly.

# Task D

For the given example:

```xprolog
% Example 4 input grid_width6_height9
object(input4_idP48kmo7_t4_l1_b4_r6_w6_h1_m6_shapeRectangle_scalex6_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input4_idP33ffe7_t1_l3_b2_r4_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(input4_idPfe7a8k_t6_l1_b7_r2_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
```

First, we apply the selection criteria. We see that the object `idP33ffe7` is the closest to the top left corner (t=1, l=1). Thus, this object is selected.

Then, we preserve the object's shape and mass. We see that the selected object is already a Rectangle and its mass is 4.

Next, we reposition the object to the top left corner of the grid, updating its 't', 'l', 'b', and 'r' coordinates to (t=1, l=1, b=2, r=2).

Lastly, we resize the grid to match the object's size, which is 2x2. 

So, the predicted output would be:

```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width2_height2
object(output4_idP33ffe7_t1_l1_b2_r2_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
```
