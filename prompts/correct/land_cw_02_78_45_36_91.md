# Answer

## Transformation A

The transformation removes the first line of the input, which contains the width and height of the image. Then it keeps the remaining lines as they are.

## Width and Height

The width and height are given in the first line of the input, separated by a space. For example, "2 1" means the image has 2 columns and 1 row.

## Transformation C - Output

To compute the output for `Transformation C`, we need to read the first line of the input, which contains the width and height of the image. In this case, it is "2 1". This means the image has 2 columns and 1 row. Then, we read the second line of the input, which contains the pixel values. In this case, it is "9 4 5". We need to transform these pixel values into a new format. Since there are 2 columns and 1 row, we can simply write them in a single line separated by spaces. So the output for `Transformation C` should be "1 2\n9\n4\n5", where "\n" represents a newline character.

## Verification

To verify that our reasoning is correct, we can run the transformation on an example input and check if the output matches our prediction. Let's use the input from `Transformation C - Input`:
```pgm
P2
# input
2 1
9
4 5
```
Applying Transformation A to this input, we get:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
4
5
```
This matches our prediction for `Transformation C - Output`, so our reasoning is correct.

## Solution

The solution for `Transformation C - Output` is:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
4
5
```
