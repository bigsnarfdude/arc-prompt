 ## Task A: Analysis

The transformations are all related to rearranging the given numbers in a specific order. Here's how I would analyze them:

1. Transformation A: The input has two lines, where the first line represents the width and height of the PGM image (2x1 in this case), and the second line contains the pixel values in row-major order. The output is obtained by changing the order of the pixel values to column-major order.

2. Transformation B: Similar to A, but with an additional constraint that if a pixel value appears more than once, it should be placed after all other unique pixel values. This means that the output will have the same pixel values as the input, but in a different order.

3. Transformation C: The input has two lines, where the first line represents the width and height of the PGM image (2x1 in this case), and the second line contains the pixel values in row-major order. The output is obtained by changing the order of the pixel values to column-major order, but if a pixel value appears more than once, it should be placed after all other unique pixel values.

4. Transformation D: This transformation is not explicitly given an input, so I can't predict the exact output without one. However, based on the previous transformations, I would expect that the output will have the same pixel values as the input, but in a different order, with any duplicate pixel values placed after all other unique pixel values.

To compute width and height from the first line of the PGM format, we can simply split the string by whitespace and take the first two numbers. The width is the first number, and the height is the second number.

## Task B: Solution

For Transformation D - Output, I would predict that the output will have the same pixel values as the input, but in a different order, with any duplicate pixel values placed after all other unique pixel values. In this case, if the input is:

```pgm
P2
# input
2 1
9
7 9
```

The output could be:

```pgm
P2
# predict this output
1 2
9
9
7
```

## Task C: Verify

To verify the solution, I would compare the predicted output with the actual output if provided. If the input is indeed:

```pgm
P2
# input
2 1
9
7 9
```

And the actual output is:

```pgm
P2
# actual output
1 2
9
9
7
```

Then my prediction would be correct.

Correct!
