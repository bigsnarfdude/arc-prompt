I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):6,(1,0):6,(2,0):6,(0,1):1,(1,1):6,(2,1):1,(0,2):8,(1,2):8,(2,2):6}
output[0] = {'width':6,'height':3,(0,0):6,(1,0):6,(2,0):6,(3,0):6,(4,0):6,(5,0):6,(0,1):1,(1,1):6,(2,1):1,(3,1):1,(4,1):6,(5,1):1,(0,2):8,(1,2):8,(2,2):6,(3,2):6,(4,2):8,(5,2):8}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):6,(1,0):8,(2,0):1,(0,1):6,(1,1):1,(2,1):1,(0,2):1,(1,2):1,(2,2):6}
output[1] = {'width':6,'height':3,(0,0):6,(1,0):8,(2,0):1,(3,0):1,(4,0):8,(5,0):6,(0,1):6,(1,1):1,(2,1):1,(3,1):1,(4,1):1,(5,1):6,(0,2):1,(1,2):1,(2,2):6,(3,2):6,(4,2):1,(5,2):1}

input[2] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):1,(1,0):1,(2,0):1,(0,1):8,(1,1):1,(2,1):6,(0,2):6,(1,2):8,(2,2):8}
output[2] = {'width':6,'height':3,(0,0):1,(1,0):1,(2,0):1,(3,0):1,(4,0):1,(5,0):1,(0,1):8,(1,1):1,(2,1):6,(3,1):6,(4,1):1,(5,1):8,(0,2):6,(1,2):8,(2,2):8,(3,2):8,(4,2):8,(5,2):6}

input[3] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):1,(1,0):1,(2,0):1,(0,1):1,(1,1):6,(2,1):6,(0,2):6,(1,2):6,(2,2):6}
output[3] = {'width':6,'height':3,(0,0):1,(1,0):1,(2,0):1,(3,0):1,(4,0):1,(5,0):1,(0,1):1,(1,1):6,(2,1):6,(3,1):6,(4,1):6,(5,1):1,(0,2):6,(1,2):6,(2,2):6,(3,2):6,(4,2):6,(5,2):6}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.
- Are the output images symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[4] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):6,(1,0):8,(2,0):6,(0,1):8,(1,1):6,(2,1):8,(0,2):1,(1,2):6,(2,2):1}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[4] = PREDICT
```

# Task A

1. The output image always has double the width of the input image while the height remains the same.
2. The output image is not a cropped area of the input.
3. The output image is not a rotated or flipped version of the input.
4. The output image is not symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.
5. The output image seems to be an extension of the input image, where each column is duplicated in the output.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments About the Observation |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Image Width | Input: 3, Output: 6 | The output width is double the input width |
| Image Height | Input: 3, Output: 3 | The output height is equal to the input height |
| Mass of Each Layer | Variable | The mass (sum of pixel values) in each layer is variable |
| Strongly Connected Clusters | Variable | The number of strongly connected clusters (group of same value pixels) in each layer is variable |
| Isolated Pixels | No | There are no isolated pixels in the input or output |
| Horizontal Lines | Yes | Horizontal lines extend edge to edge |
| Vertical Lines | Yes | Vertical lines do not extend edge to edge |
| Filled Rectangles | No | There are no filled rectangles |
| Hollow Boxes | No | There are no hollow boxes |
| Shapes | Lines | The shapes observed are primarily lines, no L-shapes, T-shapes, H-shapes, E-shapes, Plus-shapes, Tetris-shapes are observed |
| Tiling | No | There doesn't seem to be any tiling in the output |
| Holes | No | There are no shapes with holes |
| Border Holes | No | There are no shapes with holes in the borders |
| Landmarks | No | There are no clear landmarks to draw lines between |
| Shape Preservation | Yes | The output shape is similar to the input but doubled in width |
| Boolean Operations | No | No Boolean operations are observed |
| Object Movement | No | No object movement is observed |

# Task C
The input is converted to the output by duplicating each column in the input image. The operation does not involve any rotations, cropping, or flipping. The width of the output image is doubled, while the height remains the same as the input.

# Task D
For the given input, following the pattern of duplicating each column from the input, the output will be as follows:

```python
output[4] = {'width':6,'height':3,(0,0):6,(1,0):8,(2,0):6,(3,0):6,(4,0):8,(5,0):6,(0,1):8,(1,1):6,(2,1):8,(3,1):8,(4,1):6,(5,1):8,(0,2):1,(1,2):6,(2,2):1,(3,2):1,(4,2):6,(5,2):1}
```
