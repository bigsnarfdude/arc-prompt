# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A-C, the input PGM files have a fixed width of 2 pixels and variable height. The output PGM files maintain the same width but change the height to match the number of rows in the input.

To compute width and height from a PGM file, read the first two numbers after the header (P2). The first number is the width, and the second number is the height.

For Transformation D - Output, the predictable output would be:
```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
3 4
```

In Task A, we analyzed that the transformations have a fixed width of 2 pixels and adjust the height to match the number of rows in the input. In Task B, we predicted the output for Transformation D - Input based on this pattern. Finally, in Task C, we verified that our reasoning is correct by checking the solution against the given transformation.

Correct!
