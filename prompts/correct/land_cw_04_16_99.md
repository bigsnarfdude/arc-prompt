# Answer

## Analysis

The transformation takes an input PGM file and produces an output PGM file with the same width and height but with different pixel values. The width and height are determined by the first two numbers in the input file, which represent the dimensions of the image. In this case, the width is 2 and the height is 1.

## Solution

To solve `Transformation C - Output`, we need to determine the correct pixel values for the output PGM file. Since the width and height are already given as 2 and 1 respectively, we just need to fill in the pixel values based on the input values. In this case, the input has two lines:
```
9
9 9
```
The first line represents the value of the top-left pixel, which is 9. The second line represents the values of the bottom-left and bottom-right pixels, which are both 9. Therefore, the output PGM file should look like this:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
9
9
```
## Verify

By comparing the input and output files, we can see that the width and height are indeed the same (both 2), and the pixel values match the given input. Therefore, our reasoning is correct and the solution is valid. The output PGM file should look like this:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
9
9
```
