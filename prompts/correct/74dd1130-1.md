I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):2,(2,0):1,(0,1):1,(1,1):5,(2,1):1,(0,2):5,(1,2):2,(2,2):2}
output[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):1,(2,0):5,(0,1):2,(1,1):5,(2,1):2,(0,2):1,(1,2):1,(2,2):2}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):2,(2,0):5,(0,1):6,(1,1):2,(2,1):2,(0,2):5,(1,2):5,(2,2):5}
output[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):6,(2,0):5,(0,1):2,(1,1):2,(2,1):5,(0,2):5,(1,2):2,(2,2):5}

input[2] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):9,(1,0):9,(2,0):5,(0,1):5,(1,1):5,(2,1):8,(0,2):5,(1,2):8,(2,2):9}
output[2] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):9,(1,0):5,(2,0):5,(0,1):9,(1,1):5,(2,1):8,(0,2):5,(1,2):8,(2,2):9}

input[3] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):6,(2,0):6,(0,1):2,(1,1):1,(2,1):1,(0,2):2,(1,2):6,(2,2):2}
output[3] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):2,(1,0):2,(2,0):2,(0,1):6,(1,1):1,(2,1):6,(0,2):6,(1,2):1,(2,2):2}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[4] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):9,(1,0):3,(2,0):4,(0,1):9,(1,1):4,(2,1):4,(0,2):9,(1,2):3,(2,2):4}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[4] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
1. The output images seem to be modified versions of the input ones, rather than being cropped or rotated from the input.
2. The output is not the same as the input. 
3. The output doesn't seem to be a cropped out area from the input.
4. The output does not appear to be a rotation of the input.
5. The output does not seem to be a flip of the input either horizontally or vertically.
6. The output doesn't appear to be a diagonal flip of the input. 

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
| :--------------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Mass of Each Layer | Varies | The mass of each layer changes from input to output, indicating some transformation is applied. |
| Strongly Connected Clusters | Absent | There are no strongly connected clusters inside each layer. |
| Layer Sorting | No | There doesn't seem to be any sorting of layers based on mass. |
| Isolated Pixels | Yes | Some isolated pixels do change layer. |
| Horizontal Lines | Yes, not edge to edge | There are horizontal lines, but they do not extend from edge to edge. |
| Vertical Lines | Yes, not edge to edge | There are vertical lines, but they do not extend from edge to edge. |
| Stripes | Absent | There are no stripes with evenly spaced lines. |
| Rectangles | Yes | There are filled rectangles. |
| Hollow Boxes | Absent | There are no hollow boxes. |
| Shapes | Yes, mostly rectangles | Most shapes in the output are rectangles. |
| Tiles | Absent | The output does not contain tiles being used multiple times. |
| Shapes with Holes | Absent | No shapes with holes are present. |
| Border with Small Holes | Absent | No borders have small holes. |
| Line Connecting Landmarks | Absent | There doesn't seem to be a line connecting landmarks. |
| Shape Layer Change | Yes | Some shapes change layer but preserve their shape. |
| Shape Move | No | There doesn't seem to be relative x,y movement. |
| Boolean Operations | No | There don't appear to be boolean operations between layers. |
| Tiny Object Layer Change | Yes | Small objects may change layer depending on their proximity to larger objects. |

# Task C
From the observations above, the input to output transformation seems to involve reassigning the values of pixels based on their relative positions and the values of their neighboring pixels. Pixels with higher values tend to move towards the center while lower values move towards the corners.

# Task D
For this example, based on previous patterns, the pixel values should move towards the center or corners depending on their initial value. The higher value (9) should move to the center and the lower values should spread towards the corners.

The code should look something like this:
```python
output[4] = {'width':3,'height':3,(0,0):9,(1,0):9,(2,0):9,(0,1):3,(1,1):4,(2,1):3,(0,2):4,(1,2):4,(2,2):4}
```
