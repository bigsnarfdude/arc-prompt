# Task

This task is completed when the subtasks have been completed.

Fill in your answer into the `Answer Template`.

## Subtask A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common, like abstraction and reasoning. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

## Subtask B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

## Subtask C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

## Subtask A: Analysis

The transformations involve swapping the first two elements of the second row in the PGM header, which represents the width and height of the image. This swap does not affect the actual pixel data in the image.

To compute the width and height from the input PGM, simply read the first two numbers in the second line.

## Subtask B: Solution

For Transformation D - Output, the correct answer is:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
4 9
```

## Subtask C: Verify

By swapping the first two elements of the second row in the input PGM header, we obtain the expected output. The width remains unchanged at 1 and the height changes from 2 to 2 (swapped with the width), resulting in the correct answer.

Correct!
