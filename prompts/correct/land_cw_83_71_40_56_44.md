 The transformations have in common that they read each line of the input image, apply a transformation rule to each pixel value, and write the transformed pixel values to the corresponding position in the output image. The width and height are determined by the number of pixels in the first line of the input image.

To compute the width, we simply take the length of the first line. To compute the height, we take the number of lines in the input image. In this case, since it is a PGM image with a header line, we subtract one from the total number of lines to get the actual number of pixels in each row (height).

For Transformation E - Output, the transformation rule is to keep the first pixel value unchanged and set all other pixel values to 4. Therefore, the output image should have a width of 2 and a height of 1, with the first pixel value being 9 and all other pixel values being 4. So the output image would be:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
4
4
```

Correct!
