I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.




# Task A
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.


# Task B
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width10_height10
object(input4_idP03hft3_t9_l2_b9_r2_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input4_idPj8kdf4_t3_l3_b8_r8_w6_h6_m20_shapeBox_scaleUnknown, transform(all)).
object(input4_idP3d53ef_t9_l9_b9_r9_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

% Example 4 output grid_width10_height10
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output4_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A
The transformations that occur from input to output seem to follow these observations:

1. Objects with shape type `Rectangle` and size 1x1 (i.e., `w1_h1_m1`) appear to be duplicated twice and each of these copies is scaled by a factor of 2 in both the x and y dimensions, resulting in objects of size 2x2 and a mass of 4 (`w2_h2_m4`). This operation increases the number of objects in the grid.

2. The duplicated objects are placed at two new locations. The placement of these new objects seems to be determined by the original object's position relative to the object with the shape type `Box` (which serves as a sort of stationary landmark). One of the new objects is placed to the upper left of the `Box` object and the other to the upper right of it. 

3. The original objects stay in their original positions.

4. The `Box` object stays stationary and does not seem to change or affect other objects.

# Task B
Using the above observations, the following should be the output of the fourth example:

```prolog
