I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width3_height1
object(input4_idP847fa3_t1_l1_b1_r1_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input4_idPj8kdf4_t1_l2_b1_r2_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input4_idP989a7f_t1_l3_b1_r3_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

% Example 4 output grid_width1_height1
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output4_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A

Looking at the output objects across all examples, a common trait is that they all are rectangles with dimensions of 1x1 (w1, h1), they are positioned at grid location (t1, l1, b1, r1), and they all preserve their original shape (shapeRectangle) and scale (scalex1_scaley1). 

There doesn't seem to be a specific sorting rule that the output objects follow based on the available examples. The identifiers of the objects (ids) in the output are not in a numerical or alphabetical order, and neither are they sorted based on any of the dimensions or mass.

# Task B

From the input to the output, the primary transformation seems to be a form of reduction or simplification. Each example starts with multiple objects in the grid and ends with just a single object in the output. The size, position, and shape of the object are preserved, but the location changes to (t1, l1, b1, r1). The ID of the object in the output seems to be one of the IDs from the input objects, but there's no discernable pattern as to which ID is chosen.

Reasoning for inserting new objects: There's no evidence in the given examples that new objects are being inserted in the output. Each output contains just one object that already existed in the input.

Reasoning for deleting existing objects: It appears that all but one of the objects from the input are being deleted in each example. The selection criteria for the remaining object is unclear from the examples given. It could be based on a variety of factors such as the ID, position, size, or other characteristics of the object.

# Task C

The orientation of the output objects is consistently a 1x1 rectangle located at grid position (t1, l1, b1, r1). As there is only one object in the output, it doesn't seem like there would be any benefit to laying out the objects in another direction. 

# Task D

Given the examples, the rules seem to be simplifying the grid to a single object positioned at (t1, l1, b1, r1). The selection of the object to remain in the output is unclear. Based on the examples, it might be the second object in the list of objects. If that pattern holds, the output of example 4 would be the second object: `idPj8kdf4`. However, this is just a hypothesis, and without more examples or information, this prediction could be incorrect.

Predicted output:

```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width1_height1
object(output4_idPj8kdf4_t1_l1_b1_r1_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
```
