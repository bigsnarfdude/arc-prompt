I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(5,4):8,(1,5):3,(8,6):2}
output[0] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(4,3):4,(5,3):4,(6,3):4,(0,4):6,(1,4):6,(2,4):6,(4,4):4,(5,4):8,(6,4):4,(0,5):6,(1,5):3,(2,5):6,(4,5):4,(5,5):4,(6,5):4,(7,5):1,(8,5):1,(9,5):1,(0,6):6,(1,6):6,(2,6):6,(7,6):1,(8,6):2,(9,6):1,(7,7):1,(8,7):1,(9,7):1}

input[1] = {'width':6,'height':6,'background':0,(3,1):3}
output[1] = {'width':6,'height':6,'background':0,(2,0):6,(3,0):6,(4,0):6,(2,1):6,(3,1):3,(4,1):6,(2,2):6,(3,2):6,(4,2):6}

input[2] = {'width':16,'height':16,'background':0,(12,3):3,(3,10):2}
output[2] = {'width':16,'height':16,'background':0,(11,2):6,(12,2):6,(13,2):6,(11,3):6,(12,3):3,(13,3):6,(11,4):6,(12,4):6,(13,4):6,(2,9):1,(3,9):1,(4,9):1,(2,10):1,(3,10):2,(4,10):1,(2,11):1,(3,11):1,(4,11):1}

input[3] = {'width':6,'height':6,'background':0,(2,2):8}
output[3] = {'width':6,'height':6,'background':0,(1,1):4,(2,1):4,(3,1):4,(1,2):4,(2,2):8,(3,2):4,(1,3):4,(2,3):4,(3,3):4}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[4] = {'width':16,'height':16,'background':0,(1,1):3,(13,10):2,(2,14):8}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[4] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
The output expands the location of non-background pixels from the input by spreading them out in a 3x3 square around their original position, except if there is already a pixel in the output. If there is, the new pixel doesn't overwrite the existing one. The pixel values in the expanded locations are dependent on the input pixel value. Input value 2 results in output pixels with value 1, value 3 results in output pixels with value 6, and value 8 results in output pixels with value 4.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Pixel Expansion  | 3x3 | Each non-background pixel from the input image is expanded into a 3x3 square in the output image, if the space isn't already occupied. |
| Mass of each layer | Varies | Depends on the number of non-background pixels in the input image and their values. |
| Strongly connected clusters | None observed | No strongly connected clusters of the same pixel value were observed. |
| Mass and layer sorting | No relation observed | No apparent relationship between the mass of a layer and its sorting. |
| Isolated pixels | Change layer sometimes | If an isolated pixel is surrounded by a larger mass of another layer, it changes layer. |
| Lines and shapes | No specific shapes or lines observed | No specific lines, shapes, or patterns like T-shapes, L-shapes, boxes, etc., were observed. |
| Layer change triggers | Mass of adjacent layer | Layer change for isolated pixels seems to be triggered by being surrounded by a larger mass of another layer. |
| Object movement | No movement observed | No movement of objects relative to x,y observed. |
| Boolean operations | Not observed | No apparent boolean operations observed. |
| Tiny object layer change | Yes, based on surrounding layer | A tiny object can change layer if it's surrounded by a larger object in that layer. |

# Task C
The action converting input to output seems to be expansion of the non-background pixels in the input to form a 3x3 square in the output, depending on the available space. The value of the expanded pixels depends on the value of the original pixel. An input pixel with value 2 results in expanded pixels with value 1, a pixel with value 3 results in expanded pixels with value 6, and a pixel with value 8 results in expanded pixels with value 4.

# Task D
Based on previous observations, for each non-background pixel in the input, a 3x3 square will be created in the output around the original position with values depending on the input pixel's value. Therefore, for the given input, the output should be:

```python
output[4] = {'width':16,'height':16,'background':0,
             (0,0):6,(1,0):6,(2,0):6,
             (0,1):6,(1,1):3,(2,1):6,
             (0,2):6,(1,2):6,(2,2):6,
             (12,9):1,(13,9):1,(14,9):1,
             (12,10):1,(13,10):2,(14,10):1,
             (12,11):1,(13,11):1,(14,11):1,
             (1,13):4,(2,13):4,(3,13):4,
             (1,14):4,(2,14):8,(3,14):4,
             (1,15):4,(2,15):4,(3,15):4}
```
