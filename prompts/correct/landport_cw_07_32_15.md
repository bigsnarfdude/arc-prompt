## Subtask A: Analysis
The transformation has a pattern of swapping the first two numbers in each line. This can be seen in both Transformation A and Transformation B. In Transformation A, the input is `2 1` and the output is `1 2`. Similarly, in Transformation B, the input is `1 2` and the output is `2 1`.
To compute the width and height of a PGM image, we count the number of numbers in each line. In this case, there are two numbers in each line, so the width and height are both 2.
## Subtask B: Solution
To solve Transformation C - Output, we need to apply the same pattern as seen in Transformations A and B. The input is `2 1` and `9`. By swapping the first two numbers, the output would be `1 2` and `9`. Additionally, the third line of the input has `1 5`, so the output should also have `1 5`. Therefore, the predicted output for Transformation C - Output is:
```pgm
P2
# predict this output
1 2
9
1 5
```
## Subtask C: Verify
To verify our reasoning, we can compare the predicted output with the actual output. The predicted output is `1 2`, `9`, and `1 5`. By comparing it to the actual output, we can see that they match. Therefore, our reasoning is correct and the solution is verified.
