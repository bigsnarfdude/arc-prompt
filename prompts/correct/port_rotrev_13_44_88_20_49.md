 In Transformations A, B, and C, the input PGM files have a fixed width of 2 columns (P2) and an unknown height. The transformation rearranges the numbers in the input file while maintaining the same number of rows as the input.

To compute the height, we count the number of non-empty lines in the input. In Transformation C, there are three non-empty lines, so the height is 3.

For Transformation C - Output, we can predict that the first row will have the numbers swapped (2 1), the second row will remain the same (9), and the third row will have its elements rearranged to be in ascending order (8 8). The output PGM file should look like this:

```pgm
P2
# predict this output
2 1
9
8 8
```

Correct!
