I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(0,0):6,(0,1):6,(0,2):6,(0,3):6,(0,4):6,(0,5):6,(0,6):6,(0,7):6,(0,8):6,(0,9):6,(0,10):6,(0,11):6,(0,12):6,(0,13):6,(0,14):6}
output[0] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(0,0):6,(14,0):2,(0,1):6,(13,1):2,(0,2):6,(12,2):2,(0,3):6,(11,3):2,(0,4):6,(10,4):2,(0,5):6,(9,5):2,(0,6):6,(8,6):2,(0,7):6,(7,7):2,(0,8):6,(6,8):2,(0,9):6,(5,9):2,(0,10):6,(4,10):2,(0,11):6,(3,11):2,(0,12):6,(2,12):2,(0,13):6,(1,13):2,(0,14):6,(1,14):4,(2,14):4,(3,14):4,(4,14):4,(5,14):4,(6,14):4,(7,14):4,(8,14):4,(9,14):4,(10,14):4,(11,14):4,(12,14):4,(13,14):4,(14,14):4}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(0,0):5,(0,1):5,(0,2):5}
output[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(0,0):5,(2,0):2,(0,1):5,(1,1):2,(0,2):5,(1,2):4,(2,2):4}

input[2] = {'width':7,'height':7,'background':0,(0,0):8,(0,1):8,(0,2):8,(0,3):8,(0,4):8,(0,5):8,(0,6):8}
output[2] = {'width':7,'height':7,'background':0,(0,0):8,(6,0):2,(0,1):8,(5,1):2,(0,2):8,(4,2):2,(0,3):8,(3,3):2,(0,4):8,(2,4):2,(0,5):8,(1,5):2,(0,6):8,(1,6):4,(2,6):4,(3,6):4,(4,6):4,(5,6):4,(6,6):4}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.
- Are the output images symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[3] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(0,0):3,(0,1):3,(0,2):3,(0,3):3,(0,4):3,(0,5):3,(0,6):3,(0,7):3,(0,8):3,(0,9):3}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[3] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
- The input images consist of a vertical line of pixels with the same value positioned at (0, y), where y ranges from 0 to the height of the image - 1.
- The output images also contain a vertical line at (0, y), but with additional pixels forming a horizontal line at the bottom of the image. The vertical line on the right side of the image decreases as it moves downwards, resembling a line of the right triangle.
- The output is not a cropped version of the input.
- The output does not resemble a rotated or flipped version of the input.
- The output images are not symmetric around the x-axis or y-axis, but they do exhibit a form of diagonal symmetry (with respect to a line y = -x + width), especially noticeable in the first and third examples.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|---|---|---|
| Layer Mass | Varies | Each layer corresponds to different pixel values.|
| Connected Clusters | 1 per layer | Each layer forms a single connected entity. |
| Horizontal Lines | Yes, bottom edge | A line of pixels with the same value appears at the bottom of the image in the output. |
| Vertical Lines | Yes, left edge | A line of pixels with the same value appears at the left edge in the input and output. |
| Shapes | Triangular shape | The outputs form a right triangle shape. |
| Moved Shapes | No | The shapes don't move, they are transformed. |
| Shape-Layer Change | No | Shapes don't change layer, but the pixel value is modified in the output. |

# Task C
- Keep the vertical line from the input image in the output image without changes.
- For each pixel (x, y) in the vertical line, add a pixel (y, x) in the output with a new layer value of 2.
- When x equals y, change the pixel value to 4.
- Fill the last row of the output image with pixels having the layer value 4.

# Task D
The pattern observed in the transformations from the input to output can be applied to the new input. The left vertical line will remain unchanged. Pixels will be added to form a triangle with a vertex at (0,0), with the right-side vertical line having a new value of 2. Finally, the bottom line will have a value of 4.

```python
output[3] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(0,0):3,(9,0):2,(0,1):3,(8,1):2,(0,2):3,(7,2):2,(0,3):3,(6,3):2,(0,4):3,(5,4):2,(0,5):3,(4,5):2,(0,6):3,(3,6):2,(0,7):3,(2,7):2,(0,8):3,(1,8):2,(0,9):3,(1,9):4,(2,9):4,(3,9):4,(4,9):4,(5,9):4,(6,9):4,(7,9):4,(8,9):4,(9,9):4}
```
