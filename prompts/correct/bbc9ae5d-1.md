I'm doing CPP experiments.


These are run-length encoded images.
The RLE used here only uses black and white. There are no other colors than black or white. Example `3B7W2B` becomes `3 black, 7 white, 2 black`.

The ID indicates the layer number. Multiple images can be stacked and black can be considered transparent.


```cpp
input[0] = "width6:height1:ID0:2B4W:ID1:2W4B";
output[0] = "width6:height3:ID0:2B4W 3B3W 4B2W:ID1:2W4B 3W3B 4W2B";

input[1] = "width8:height1:ID0:1B7W:ID2:1W7B";
output[1] = "width8:height4:ID0:1B7W 2B6W 3B5W 4B4W:ID2:1W7B 2W6B 3W5B 4W4B";

input[2] = "width10:height1:ID0:3B7W:ID5:3W7B";
output[2] = "width10:height5:ID0:3B7W 4B6W 5B5W 6B4W 7B3W:ID5:3W7B 4W6B 5W5B 6W4B 7W3B";

input[3] = "width6:height1:ID0:4B2W:ID8:4W2B";
output[3] = "width6:height3:ID0:4B2W 5B1W 6B:ID8:4W2B 5W1B 6W";

input[4] = "width6:height1:ID0:1B5W:ID7:1W5B";
output[4] = "width6:height3:ID0:1B5W 2B4W 3B3W:ID7:1W5B 2W4B 3W3B";
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Decode the RLE images to your internal visualization. Take care that the number of Bs and number of Ws sums to the width parameter.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there shapes such as boxes, L-shape, H-shape, E-shape, Plus-shape, Tetris shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape move between layer IDs.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```cpp
input[5] = "width12:height1:ID0:3B9W:ID1:3W9B";
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```cpp
output[5] = "width12:height6:PREDICT";
```

# Task A
The images are line drawings represented by run-length encoded black and white pixels. Each line gradually increases the black section by one pixel and decreases the white section by one pixel for each step in the vertical direction. Images appear mirrored around a central axis.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layer Mass | Equal in all cases | All layers contain equal number of black and white pixels, maintaining the total width. |
| Cluster Count | One per layer | Each layer forms a single cluster, either a line of black pixels or a line of white pixels. |
| Mass Relation | Not applicable | Each layer has the same mass, so it cannot determine sorting. |
| Horizontal Lines | Yes | All lines extend edge to edge horizontally. |
| Vertical Lines | No | No vertical lines observed. |
| Shapes | No recognizable shapes | The images only represent lines, no other shapes are discernible. |
| Landmark Connection | No | No landmarks to connect lines. |
| Shape Movement | No | The shape doesn't move across layer IDs or in relative x,y. |
| Boolean Operations | No evidence | No operations like xor, and, or observed. |

# Task C
The transformation from input to output involves increasing the height of each image by a step size of 1 and adjusting the black and white portions of each line accordingly. This creates an illusion of lines being pulled apart vertically.

# Task D
In the provided input, the black and white sections of both layers start with 3 pixels and the remaining pixels are occupied by the opposite color. Following the pattern observed in previous examples, for each subsequent row, the black section would increase by 1 pixel and the white section would decrease by 1 pixel, and vice versa for the other color.

So the prediction for the output would be:

```cpp
output[5] = "width12:height6:ID0:3B9W 4B8W 5B7W 6B6W 7B5W 8B4W:ID1:3W9B 4W8B 5W7B 6W6B 7W5B 8W4B";
```
