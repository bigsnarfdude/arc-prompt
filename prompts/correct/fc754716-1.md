I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(1,1):2}
output[0] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(0,0):2,(1,0):2,(2,0):2,(0,1):2,(2,1):2,(0,2):2,(1,2):2,(2,2):2}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':5,'background':0,(1,2):3}
output[1] = {'width':3,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):3,(1,0):3,(2,0):3,(0,1):3,(2,1):3,(0,2):3,(2,2):3,(0,3):3,(2,3):3,(0,4):3,(1,4):3,(2,4):3}

input[2] = {'width':7,'height':5,'background':0,(3,2):1}
output[2] = {'width':7,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):1,(1,0):1,(2,0):1,(3,0):1,(4,0):1,(5,0):1,(6,0):1,(0,1):1,(6,1):1,(0,2):1,(6,2):1,(0,3):1,(6,3):1,(0,4):1,(1,4):1,(2,4):1,(3,4):1,(4,4):1,(5,4):1,(6,4):1}

input[3] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(2,2):6}
output[3] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):6,(1,0):6,(2,0):6,(3,0):6,(4,0):6,(0,1):6,(4,1):6,(0,2):6,(4,2):6,(0,3):6,(4,3):6,(0,4):6,(1,4):6,(2,4):6,(3,4):6,(4,4):6}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.
- Are the output images symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.
- Are pixels gravitating towards one of the edges: top, bottom, left, right.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[4] = {'width':7,'height':9,'background':0,(3,4):8}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[4] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
- All the input images contain a single non-background pixel.
- In the output, the pixel value of this non-background pixel is preserved, and is extended to the borders of the image in the form of a border or frame. 
- No, the output is not a cropped out area from the input.
- The output is not rotated or flipped version of the input.
- No diagonal flipping is observed.
- The output images are symmetric around both x-axis and y-axis.
- The non-background pixels in the output are gravitating towards all edges: top, bottom, left, right.

# Task B
| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mass of each layer | 1 in input, varies in output | In input, only one pixel has non-background value. In output, the number increases. |
| Strongly connected clusters | 1 in input, 1 in output | Only one connected component observed in both input and output. |
| Mass related to sorting of layers | Not applicable | Only one layer is present. |
| Isolated pixels | Yes | Single pixel with non-background value in the input. |
| Horizontal and vertical lines | Yes | In output, the non-background pixel extends to form horizontal and vertical lines reaching the edges. |
| Stripes, rectangles, boxes, L-shapes, T-shapes, H-shapes, E-shapes, Plus-shapes, Tetris-shapes | No | None observed. |
| Other shapes | Frame or border | Non-background pixel forms a border in the output. |
| Tile identical to input image | No | Not observed. |
| Shapes with holes | No | No such shapes observed. |
| Line connecting landmarks | No | No such lines observed. |
| Boolean operations | No | No such operations observed. |
| Small object changing layer due to proximity | No | No such cases observed. |

# Task C
The action that converts input to output can be summarized as:
- Identify the non-background pixel in the input.
- In the output, draw a border or frame with this pixel value reaching the edges of the image.

# Task D
The output should be a 7x9 image with a frame of pixel value 8. The frame should reach all edges of the image, thus creating a border.

```python
output[4] = {'width':7, 'height':9, 'background':0, 
             (0,0):8, (1,0):8, (2,0):8, (3,0):8, (4,0):8, (5,0):8, (6,0):8, 
             (0,1):8, (6,1):8,
             (0,2):8, (6,2):8,
             (0,3):8, (6,3):8,
             (0,4):8, (6,4):8,
             (0,5):8, (6,5):8,
             (0,6):8, (6,6):8,
             (0,7):8, (6,7):8,
             (0,8):8, (1,8):8, (2,8):8, (3,8):8, (4,8):8, (5,8):8, (6,8):8}
```
