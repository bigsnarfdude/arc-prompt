I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects, since it may impact the `id` assigned to the object.

There number of output objects may be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be


```prolog
% Example 5 input grid_width19_height17
object(input5_idP3d53ef_t10_l8_b14_r12_w5_h5_m23_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(flip_flip180)).
object(input5_idP3d53ef_t8_l15_b12_r19_w5_h5_m23_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(rot0_rot180)).
object(input5_idP3d53ef_t8_l1_b12_r5_w5_h5_m21_shapeBoxWith2x2Holes_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input5_idP3d53ef_t2_l10_b6_r14_w5_h5_m23_shapeBoxWithTwoHoles_scaleUnknown, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
object(input5_idP3d53ef_t1_l2_b5_r6_w5_h5_m23_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot90_rot270_flip_flip180)).

% Example 5 output grid_width5_height5
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output5_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

Based on the previous examples, the following transformations seem to be occurring:

1. **Select an Object**: The object with the lowest `m` value is selected. If there are multiple objects with the same `m` value, the object closest to the top-left is chosen. If multiple objects fit that criteria, the one with the lowest ID value is selected.

2. **Transform to Fit Grid**: The selected object is transformed to fit within a 5x5 grid.

3. **Adjust Transformations**: The transformations (rotations and flips) of the object are adjusted to match the ones in the input. If no transformations were applied in the input, no transformations are applied in the output.

Using these rules, the transformations for Example 5 would be:

1. Select the object `input5_idP3d53ef_t8_l1_b12_r5_w5_h5_m21_shapeBoxWith2x2Holes_scalex1_scaley1` as it has the lowest `m` value (21).

2. Transform it to fit within a 5x5 grid.

3. The object in the input has the transformation `all`. Apply this transformation to the object in the output.

So, the prediction for the output would be:

```prolog
% Example 5 output grid_width5_height5
object(output5_idP3d53ef_t1_l1_b5_r5_w5_h5_m21_shapeBoxWith2x2Holes_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
```
