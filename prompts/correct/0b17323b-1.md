I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(1,1):1,(3,3):1,(5,5):1}
output[0] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(1,1):1,(3,3):1,(5,5):1,(7,7):2,(9,9):2,(11,11):2,(13,13):2}

input[1] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(0,0):1,(4,4):1,(8,8):1}
output[1] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(0,0):1,(4,4):1,(8,8):1,(12,12):2}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.
- Are the output images symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.
- Are pixels gravitating towards one of the edges: top, bottom, left, right.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[2] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(0,0):1,(3,3):1,(6,6):1}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[2] = PREDICT
```

# Task A

- The images are represented as dictionaries with dimensions, background color, and pixel positions with their values.
- In both cases, it seems that the output introduces new pixels at positions (x, x) where x is an odd number starting from 7 and greater than any x in the input pixel positions.
- The output is not a cropped area from the input; instead, it has added pixels.
- The output is not a rotated, flipped, or diagonally flipped version of the input.
- The output images do not appear to be symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis, or both.
- There is no obvious trend of pixels gravitating towards one of the edges: top, bottom, left, right.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Layer Mass | 1 in all cases | The value assigned to the pixel seems to represent its layer. In both inputs and outputs, all pixels are in layer 1 or 2. |
| Connected Clusters | 1 in all cases | Each layer forms a single cluster, connected diagonally. |
| Mass and Layer Sorting | No correlation | The layer with greater mass is not necessarily placed first. |
| Isolated Pixels | Yes | All pixels in the images are isolated, with no adjacent pixel of the same layer. |
| Lines and Rectangles | No | The pixel placement does not form horizontal or vertical lines, or rectangles. |
| Shapes | Diagonal lines | The placement of pixels forms diagonal lines in all images. |
| Layer Change | Yes | Some pixels in input are in layer 1 but corresponding pixels in output are in layer 2. |
| Relative Movement | Yes | New pixels are added in the output at positions relative to those in the input. |

# Task C

The action that converts input to output involves:

1. Retaining all input pixels in the output.
2. Adding new pixels at positions (x, x) for odd x values greater than any x in the input pixel positions. These new pixels are placed in layer 2.

# Task D

Given the observed pattern, for `input[2]`, the output should include all pixels from the input, plus additional pixels at positions (9, 9) and (12, 12) in layer 2, since 9 and 12 are the next odd numbers greater than the maximum x value in the input, which is 6.

```python
output[2] = {'width':15,'height':15,'background':0,(0,0):1,(3,3):1,(6,6):1, (9,9):2, (12,12):2}
```
