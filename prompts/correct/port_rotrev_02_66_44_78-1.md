# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation C - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A, B, and C, the input PGM files have a fixed width of 2 numbers per line (P2) and a variable height. The transformation swaps the first two numbers in each line except for the first line.

To compute the width, we look at the header "P2" which indicates that there are 2 numbers per line. To compute the height, we count the number of lines excluding the header.

For Transformation C - Input, the output should be:
```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
4 4
```

Correct!
