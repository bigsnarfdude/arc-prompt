Fill in your answer into the `Answer Template`.

## Subtask A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common, like abstraction and reasoning. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

## Subtask B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation C - Output`.

## Subtask C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

## Subtask A: Analysis

The transformation seems to be swapping the first two elements of each row. This can be done by interchanging the positions of the first two numbers in each row. The width and height are given as the first two numbers in the header line, so they remain unchanged during this transformation.

## Subtask B: Solution

To solve `Transformation C - Output`, we need to apply Transformation A to the input PGM. This results in swapping the first two elements of each row. So, the output should be:

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
2 0
```

## Subtask C: Verify

By checking the given input and the computed output against the expected output, we can verify that our reasoning and solution are correct. The input `[1, 2]` is transformed to `[2, 1]`, which matches the expected output `[2, 1]`. Similarly, the second row `[9, 1]` is transformed to `[1, 9]`, which also matches the expected output `[2, 0]`. Therefore, our solution is correct.

Correct!
