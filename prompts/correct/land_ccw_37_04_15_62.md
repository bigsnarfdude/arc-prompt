# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation C - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A and B, the input PGM files are transformed by rearranging the pixel values in a specific order. The width and height of the output can be computed from the first two numbers in the input file (e.g., 2 1 for width 2 and height 1).

For Transformation C - Output, the pattern is to sort the pixel values by their second coordinate (y-coordinate) in ascending order. The resulting output will have the same width as the input but a rearranged list of pixel values based on their y-coordinates.

Solution:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
5
1
```

Correct!
