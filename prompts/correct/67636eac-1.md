I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Don't invent new IDs. Check how much an object moves relative x, y.


Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output.
Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width18_height14
object(input4_idP989a7f_t4_l2_b6_r4_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
object(input4_idP33ffe7_t3_l11_b5_r13_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
object(input4_idPfe7a8k_t5_l7_b7_r9_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).

Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

The input includes four objects all of the same shape (HUppercase), mass (7), width (3), and height (3), and transformations applied to them are identical. It seems the output transformations involve changing the position of these objects. From the patterns observed in the previous examples:

1. All the objects are resized to have a width and height of 3 each in the output.
2. The objects are sorted based on their positions (the left and top coordinates) and placed next to each other from left to right on the grid in the output. The objects with lower t and l coordinates are placed towards the left.
3. The grid size is minimized to fit the objects as compactly as possible.

From these observations, we can sort the four objects in example 4 based on their left coordinate (l) first and then top coordinate (t) if they have the same left coordinate. The sorted objects based on their l and t coordinates are:

1. object(input4_idP989a7f_t4_l2_b6_r4_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1)
2. object(input4_idPfe7a8k_t5_l7_b7_r9_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1)
3. object(input4_idP33ffe7_t3_l11_b5_r13_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1)
4. object(input4_idP3d53ef_t4_l15_b6_r17_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1)

The objects will be repositioned next to each other from left to right with a width of 3 each, so the grid width would be 12 (4*3). Since they are placed in a single line, the grid height will be 3. Hence, the output grid will be of size 12x3.

The predicted output for example 4 would be:

```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width12_height3
object(output4_idP989a7f_t1_l1_b3_r3_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
object(output4_idPfe7a8k_t1_l4_b3_r6_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
object(output4_idP33ffe7_t1_l7_b3_r9_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
object(output4_idP3d53ef_t1_l10_b3_r12_w3_h3_m7_shapeHUppercase_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot0_rot180_flip_flip180)).
```
