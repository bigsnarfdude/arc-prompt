# Task

This task is completed when the subtasks have been completed.

Fill in your answer into the `Answer Template`.

## Subtask A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common, like abstraction and reasoning. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

## Subtask B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

## Subtask C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

## Subtask A: Analysis

The transformations involve swapping the positions of two numbers in the second row of the PGM (Portable Graymap) image header. The width and height are determined by the first two numbers in the header, respectively.

## Subtask B: Solution

To solve `Transformation D - Output`, we need to swap the positions of the numbers 4 and 8 in the second row of the input PGM header:

```pgm
P2
# input
1 2
9
4
8
```

Swapping the numbers results in:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
8
4
```

## Subtask C: Verify

By checking the solution against the given transformation, we can confirm that it is correct. The swapped positions of the numbers in the second row match those in the example for Transformation D - Output.
