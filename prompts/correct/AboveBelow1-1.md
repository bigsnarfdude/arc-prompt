I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width10_height14
object(input4_idP48kmo7_t12_l2_b14_r5_w4_h3_m12_shapeRectangle_scalex4_scaley3, transform(all)).

# Task A

From the examples, it appears that the objects which remain in the output, are the ones which have the top edge aligned with the grid top. This rule applies across all objects of all shapes and sizes. The only exception is the 'Rectangle' shaped object, which seems to be a horizontal line of height '1', that stays stationary, serving as a landmark. So, this object is also included in the output.

Moreover, the objects are sorted in ascending order of their top edge position in the grid. If multiple objects have the same top edge position, they are sorted by the left edge in ascending order.

# Task B

Looking at the examples, we can derive the following transformations:

1. **Deleting existing objects:** Any object that doesn't have its top edge aligned with the top of the grid (excluding the horizontal 'Rectangle' landmark) is deleted.

2. **No new objects inserted:** From the given examples, there doesn't seem to be any case where a new object is inserted into the grid. The output objects are all present in the input grid.

3. **Updating existing objects:** There doesn't seem to be any changes to the existing objects that are not deleted. Their properties, including shape, scale, and mass, are preserved.

# Task C

Given that the output objects are the ones which are aligned with the top edge of the grid, it wouldn't make sense to layout them in a different direction. The coordinates of the objects that are preserved don't seem to be altered, so they should stay in the same positions.

# Task D

Based on the rules derived from the examples, here is how we should predict the output of Example 4:

* The objects that have their top edge aligned with the top of the grid are:

  1. object(input4_idP48kmo7_t1_l10_b2_r10_w1_h2_m2_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley2)
  2. object(input4_idP48kmo7_t1_l6_b3_r8_w3_h3_m9_shapeRectangle_scalex3_scaley3)
  3. object(input4_idP48kmo7_t1_l2_b2_r3_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2)

* The horizontal 'Rectangle' landmark object is:

  1. object(input4_idP989a7f_t4_l1_b4_r10_w10_h1_m10_shapeRectangle_scalex10_scaley1)

So, the output should be these four objects, sorted in ascending order of their top and left edges.

```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width10_height14
object(output4_idP48kmo7_t1_l2_b2_r3_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(output4_idP48kmo7_t1_l6_b3_r8_w3_h3_m9_shapeRectangle_scalex3_scaley3, transform(all)).
object(output4_idP48kmo7_t1_l10_b2_r10_w1_h2_m2_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(output4_idP989a7f_t4_l1_b4_r10_w10_h1_m10_shapeRectangle_scalex10_scaley1, transform(all)).
