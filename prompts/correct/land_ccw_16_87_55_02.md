 In Transformations A and B, the input PGM files are transformed by rearranging the pixel values in a specific order. The width and height can be computed from the first two numbers in the file, which represent the number of columns and rows respectively.

For Transformation C - Input, we have 2 columns and 1 row. To compute the output, we need to understand the pattern in the transformations. In both A and B, the pixel values are rearranged such that the first value becomes the last, the second value becomes the second-to-last, and so on.

Applying this pattern to Transformation C - Input, we get:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
5
5
```

Correct!
