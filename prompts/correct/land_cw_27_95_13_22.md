 The transformations have in common that they read the input PGM image line by line, starting from the second line. They store the number of pixels in the first column of each line in a variable `width`. The height is given by the number of lines in the input image.

To compute the width and height:
1. Read the first line of the input PGM image to get the magic number and the width.
2. Determine the height from the number of lines in the input image.

For Transformation C - Output, since the first column of each line contains only one pixel value, we can simply copy these values to the output image. The second column will contain the corresponding pixel values from the input image. Therefore, the output image has the same width and height as the input image.

Output:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
1 3
```

Correct!
