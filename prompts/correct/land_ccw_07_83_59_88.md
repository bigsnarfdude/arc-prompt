# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A-C, the input PGM file has two rows of data: the header row (P2) and a row with width and height followed by values. The transformation swaps the order of these two rows in the output PGM file.

To compute width and height from the input, we read the second line and split it into two parts using space as delimiter. The first part is the width, and the second part is the height.

For Transformation D - Output, the predictable output would be:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
8
8
```

Correct!
