# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation F - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution.

 The transformations have in common that they process each row of the image separately, applying a transformation function to the first two elements of the row and leaving the rest unchanged. This results in a new image with the same dimensions as the original one.

The width can be computed by reading the number of pixels from the PGM header, while the height is given by the number of lines in the image data.

For Transformation F - Output, we know that the first transformation step (A) changes the order of the first two elements in each row. The second transformation step (B) leaves the first element unchanged and swaps the positions of the second and third elements. Since the first transformation step was applied before the second one, we need to reverse the effect of the second step to get the final output. This can be achieved by swapping the positions of the second and third elements in each row again. Therefore, the final output should have the following structure:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
6 8
```

Correct!
