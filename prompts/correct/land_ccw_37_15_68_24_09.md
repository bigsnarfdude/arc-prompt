# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation E - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 Step by step analysis of the transformations reveals that they all follow a pattern where the input's first column becomes the output's second column, and the input's second column becomes the output's first column. The width is computed as the number of elements in the first row (excluding the comment), and the height is the number of rows (excluding the comment).

To compute `Transformation E - Output`, we apply the transformation pattern to the input:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
9
0
```

Reasoning for correctness: The transformation pattern is consistent across all examples, and the computed output matches the expected format.

Correct!
