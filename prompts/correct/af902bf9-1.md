I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(3,3):4,(5,3):4,(3,5):4,(5,5):4}
output[0] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(3,3):4,(5,3):4,(4,4):2,(3,5):4,(5,5):4}

input[1] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,1):4,(6,1):4,(1,6):4,(6,6):4}
output[1] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,1):4,(6,1):4,(2,2):2,(3,2):2,(4,2):2,(5,2):2,(2,3):2,(3,3):2,(4,3):2,(5,3):2,(2,4):2,(3,4):2,(4,4):2,(5,4):2,(2,5):2,(3,5):2,(4,5):2,(5,5):2,(1,6):4,(6,6):4}

input[2] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,1):4,(3,1):4,(1,3):4,(3,3):4,(4,6):4,(9,6):4,(4,9):4,(9,9):4}
output[2] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(1,1):4,(3,1):4,(2,2):2,(1,3):4,(3,3):4,(4,6):4,(9,6):4,(5,7):2,(6,7):2,(7,7):2,(8,7):2,(5,8):2,(6,8):2,(7,8):2,(8,8):2,(4,9):4,(9,9):4}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[3] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(5,0):4,(9,0):4,(5,4):4,(9,4):4,(0,5):4,(3,5):4,(0,8):4,(3,8):4}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[3] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
The pattern observed in each instance involves a transformation from individual, isolated pixels, usually represented as 4, to a 2D rectangle of pixels represented as 2, which are formed in the space between these isolated pixels. The initial isolated pixels remain unchanged in the output.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Layer mass | Varies | Each image layer's mass varies, but it doesn't change from input to output, except for the addition of the new layer. |
| Connected clusters | 1 per layer | Each layer consists of one strongly connected cluster. |
| Mass and layer order | No clear relation | No pattern observed relating the mass of each layer to its order. |
| Isolated pixels | Yes | Isolated pixels (4s) are always present and don't change in the output. |
| Horizontal and Vertical lines | No | There are no clear horizontal or vertical lines extending edge to edge. |
| Filled Rectangles | Yes | Filled rectangles (2s) are added in the output between the existing points. |
| Hollow boxes | No | There are no hollow boxes observed. |
| L, T, H, E, Plus, Tetris shapes | No | There are no specific shapes like these observed. |
| Line connecting landmarks | Yes | The transformation appears to add a "line" (filled rectangle) connecting the landmarks (isolated pixels). |
| Shape change | No | Shapes don't change layer or preserve their shape. They are added in new places. |
| Shape movement | No | Shapes do not move relative to x, y. |
| Boolean operations | Not apparent | No clear Boolean operations are observed between the input and output. |

# Task C
The actions that convert input to output seem to be: Find the isolated pixels (4s), determine the rectangle that could be formed by using these points as corners, fill in this rectangle with 2s. 

# Task D
Looking at the given input, there are two separate clusters of points. We will create a rectangle of 2s between the points in each cluster, leaving the existing points as they are.

```python
output[3] = {'width':10,'height':10,'background':0,(5,0):4,(9,0):4,(6,1):2,(7,1):2,(8,1):2,(6,2):2,(7,2):2,(8,2):2,(6,3):2,(7,3):2,(8,3):2,(5,4):4,(9,4):4,(0,5):4,(3,5):4,(1,6):2,(2,6):2,(1,7):2,(2,7):2,(0,8):4,(3,8):4}
```
