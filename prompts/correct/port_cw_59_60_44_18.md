 The transformations A, B, and C follow a common pattern: they all read the input PGM image line by line, starting from the second line (skipping the header), and for each pixel in the line, they compute its new intensity value based on the current pixel and the previous one.

To compute the width and height of an image, we can look at the first number in the header, which represents the width, and the second number, which represents the height. For example, in the input PGM file "input.pgm", the header reads `P2 3 3`, so the width is 3 and the height is 3.

To solve Transformation C - Output, we can follow the same pattern as transformations A and B: read the input line by line, starting from the second line, and for each pixel in the line, compute its new intensity value based on the current pixel and the previous one. The new intensity value is the minimum of the current pixel's intensity and the previous pixel's intensity plus the constant 4.

So, the output of Transformation C - Output should be:

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
4 4
```

Correct!
