 The transformations have in common that they read the input PGM image line by line, and for each pixel in a line, they write the corresponding intensity value to the output image at the same position. The width of an image can be determined by looking at the first number after the header comment (e.g., "2" in "P2 # input 2 1"), while the height is given by the number of lines in the image data.

To compute the output for Transformation C, we follow the same logic as in Transformation A and B: read each line from the input image, and write the corresponding intensity values to the output image at the same positions. In this case, the input image has a width of 2 and a height of 1, so the output image will also have a width of 2 and a height of 1. We read the first line (9) and write it as the first row in the output image. For the second line, we read the values 6 and 3, and write them as the second row in the output image. The final output will be:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
6
3
```

Correct!
