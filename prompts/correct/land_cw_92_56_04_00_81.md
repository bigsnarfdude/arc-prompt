 The transformations have in common that they read the input PGM image line by line, and for each pixel in a line, they write the corresponding intensity value to the output image at the same position. The width of an image can be determined by looking at the first number in the header (e.g., "2" in "P2"), while the height is given by the number of lines in the image data.

To compute the output for Transformation C, we follow the same logic as in Transformation A and B: read each line from the input image, and write the corresponding intensity value to the same position in the output image. However, since the input image has a different intensity value at the second pixel of the first line (0 instead of 5), this will result in a different output image.

Output for Transformation C:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
0 4
```

Correct!
