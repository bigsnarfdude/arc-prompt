I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Consider the touch point may be at the center of another object, so objects can be moved to the center point.
Check how many times an object is duplicated, does it correspond to the mass of another object or some other property.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, copy, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width10_height10
object(input4_idPz7ea0g_t9_l4_b9_r4_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input4_idPz7ea0g_t3_l1_b7_r7_w7_h5_m11_shapeUpTack_scaleUnknown, transform(rot180_flip180)).
object(input4_idPz7ea0g_t1_l4_b1_r4_w1_h1_m1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A
Looking at the output objects across all examples, here are a few common observations:

1. Each output only contains a single object.
2. All output objects have preserved the shape of an object in the input.
3. The ID of the output object is the same as the IDs in the input.
4. The total mass of each ID appears to be conserved between the input and output. This means that all instances of a certain ID in the input are combined into a single object in the output.

Therefore, it seems like the output objects are not sorted in a particular way nor are they all horizontal lines. Instead, they seem to be a single object derived from the consolidation of multiple objects with the same ID from the input.

# Task B
For the transformations from input to output, here are some steps:

1. Identify all objects with the same ID.
2. Combine these objects into a single object. The total mass of the objects with the same ID in the input is equal to the mass of the output object. This could involve a 'merge' transformation.
3. The shape of the combined object seems to be chosen from one of the shapes of the input objects with the same ID. The choice doesn't seem to be consistent across examples, as it varies from being the largest object in the first example, to the unique-shaped object in the others.
4. The transformation applied to the output object is the same as the transformation applied to the input object whose shape was retained. 
5. The output object is placed at the top-left corner of the grid. This implies a 'move' transformation to coordinates (1,1).

New objects are not inserted in these examples. Existing objects with the same ID are deleted after they are combined into a single output object.

# Task C
Regarding the orientation of the output objects, they all seem to be positioned with their top-left corner at coordinates (1,1) and expand towards the bottom-right, according to their width and height. This is seen consistently across all examples.

The layout of the objects seems to make sense given these transformations. Hence, there seems to be no need to update the coordinates or layout the objects in another direction. The orientation is primarily determined by the transformation that was applied to the selected input object.

# Task D
Based on the common characteristics and transformations identified from the previous examples, let's predict the output for Example 4. The input has three objects with the same ID 'Pz7ea0g'. These would be combined into a single object.

```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width7_height5
object(output4_idPz7ea0g_t1_l1_b5_r7_w7_h5_m13_shapeUpTack_scaleUnknown, transform(rot180_flip180)).
```
This object has ID 'Pz7ea0g' and a mass of 13, which is the total mass of all input objects with this ID. The shape is 'UpTack', which is the distinct shape of one of the input objects with this ID. The transformation is 'rot180_flip180', which is the same transformation applied to the input object of this shape. Lastly, the object is placed at the top-left corner of the grid, with a width of 7 and a height of 5, as in the input object with 'UpTack' shape.
