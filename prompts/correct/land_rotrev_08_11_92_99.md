## Transformation C - Output

```pgm

# predict this output
```

# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation C - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A and B, the input and output have the same number of rows and columns (width and height). The only difference is the order of elements in each row.

To compute width and height from a PGM file, read the first two numbers after the header.

For Transformation C - Output, we need to swap the values in the second row. So, the output should be:

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
2 9
```

Correct!
