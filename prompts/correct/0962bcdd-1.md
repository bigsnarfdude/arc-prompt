I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(2,2):7,(1,3):7,(2,3):2,(3,3):7,(2,4):7,(8,6):7,(7,7):7,(8,7):2,(9,7):7,(8,8):7}
output[0] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(0,1):2,(2,1):7,(4,1):2,(1,2):2,(2,2):7,(3,2):2,(0,3):7,(1,3):7,(2,3):2,(3,3):7,(4,3):7,(1,4):2,(2,4):7,(3,4):2,(0,5):2,(2,5):7,(4,5):2,(6,5):2,(8,5):7,(10,5):2,(7,6):2,(8,6):7,(9,6):2,(6,7):7,(7,7):7,(8,7):2,(9,7):7,(10,7):7,(7,8):2,(8,8):7,(9,8):2,(6,9):2,(8,9):7,(10,9):2}

input[1] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(3,2):8,(2,3):8,(3,3):6,(4,3):8,(3,4):8,(8,8):8,(7,9):8,(8,9):6,(9,9):8,(8,10):8}
output[1] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(1,1):6,(3,1):8,(5,1):6,(2,2):6,(3,2):8,(4,2):6,(1,3):8,(2,3):8,(3,3):6,(4,3):8,(5,3):8,(2,4):6,(3,4):8,(4,4):6,(1,5):6,(3,5):8,(5,5):6,(6,7):6,(8,7):8,(10,7):6,(7,8):6,(8,8):8,(9,8):6,(6,9):8,(7,9):8,(8,9):6,(9,9):8,(10,9):8,(7,10):6,(8,10):8,(9,10):6,(6,11):6,(8,11):8,(10,11):6}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[2] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,(8,1):3,(7,2):3,(8,2):4,(9,2):3,(8,3):3,(2,6):3,(1,7):3,(2,7):4,(3,7):3,(2,8):3}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[2] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
The images seem to represent a mapping from a small set of 'foreground' pixels in the input to a larger connected shape in the output. Each foreground pixel expands to a cross-like structure in the output, while retaining its unique layer property. This is true even if a single pixel is isolated in the input.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mass of each layer | Varies | The mass (number of pixels) of each layer is increased in the output. |
| Strongly connected clusters | 1 or 2 | Each layer has either 1 or 2 strongly connected clusters. |
| Mass related to sorting of layers | No | There doesn't appear to be a correlation. |
| Isolated pixels | Yes | Isolated pixels change layer and expand into a cross-like structure. |
| Horizontal/Vertical lines | Yes | There are horizontal and vertical lines, but they do not extend edge to edge. |
| Filled rectangles | No | None observed. |
| Hollow boxes | No | None observed. |
| Specific shapes | Cross | A cross shape is the recurring pattern in outputs. |
| Shape change layer | Yes | Pixel keeps its unique layer property while expanding into a cross. |
| Relative movement | No | Shapes seem to preserve their original position. |
| Boolean operations | No | None observed. |
| Tiny objects change layer | Yes | Single pixels expand while keeping their layer value. |

# Task C
The transformation action seems to be that each foreground pixel in the input (with a non-background layer) expands into a cross-like structure in the output. The cross spans 5 pixels in both dimensions, centered around the original pixel's location. The layer value of each pixel remains the same in the output.

# Task D
Given the consistent pattern observed in the transformations, I predict that the given input would expand in a similar manner. Each pixel would transform into a cross-like structure at its respective location while retaining its layer property.

```python
output[2] = {'width':12,'height':12,'background':0,
             (6,0):4,(8,0):3,(10,0):4,
             (7,1):4,(8,1):3,(9,1):4,
             (6,2):3,(7,2):3,(8,2):4,(9,2):3,(10,2):3,
             (7,3):4,(8,3):3,(9,3):4,
             (6,4):4,(8,4):3,(10,4):4,
             (0,5):4,(2,5):3,(4,5):4,
             (1,6):4,(2,6):3,(3,6):4,
             (0,7):3,(1,7):3,(2,7):4,(3,7):3,(4,7):3,
             (1,8):4,(2,8):3,(3,8):4,
             (0,9):4,(2,9):3,(4,9):4}
```
