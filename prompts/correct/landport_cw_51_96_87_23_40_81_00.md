## Subtask A: Analysis

The transformations involve transposing the matrix, which means swapping rows and columns. The width (number of columns) becomes the height, and the height becomes the width in the output PGM image.

To compute the width and height from a given input PGM, look at the first two numbers after the header "P2" or "P5". These represent the width and height respectively.

## Subtask B: Solution

For Transformation E - Input, the width is 1 and the height is 2. After transposing the matrix, the output will have a width of 2 and a height of 1. Therefore, the answer for Transformation E - Output should be:

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
0 4
```

## Subtask C: Verify

The solution is verified by checking that the dimensions (width and height) have been correctly swapped. In this case, the input has a width of 1 and a height of 2, while the output should have a width of 2 and a height of 1. The given solution matches these requirements.
