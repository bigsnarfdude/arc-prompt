I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':6,'height':5,'background':0,(0,1):2,(1,1):8,(2,1):2,(3,1):8,(4,1):2,(5,1):8,(0,2):2,(1,2):8,(2,2):2,(3,2):8,(4,2):2,(5,2):8}
output[0] = {'width':12,'height':5,'background':0,(0,1):2,(1,1):8,(2,1):2,(3,1):8,(4,1):2,(5,1):8,(6,1):2,(7,1):8,(8,1):2,(9,1):8,(10,1):2,(11,1):8,(0,2):2,(1,2):8,(2,2):2,(3,2):8,(4,2):2,(5,2):8,(6,2):2,(7,2):8,(8,2):2,(9,2):8,(10,2):2,(11,2):8}

input[1] = {'width':7,'height':5,'background':0,(0,2):2,(1,2):3,(2,2):3,(3,2):2,(4,2):3,(5,2):3,(6,2):2}
output[1] = {'width':14,'height':5,'background':0,(0,2):2,(1,2):3,(2,2):3,(3,2):2,(4,2):3,(5,2):3,(6,2):2,(7,2):3,(8,2):3,(9,2):2,(10,2):3,(11,2):3,(12,2):2,(13,2):3}

input[2] = {'width':8,'height':5,'background':0,(0,2):1,(1,2):2,(2,2):2,(3,2):1,(4,2):2,(5,2):2,(6,2):1,(7,2):2,(0,3):2,(1,3):1,(2,3):2,(3,3):2,(4,3):1,(5,3):2,(6,3):2,(7,3):1}
output[2] = {'width':16,'height':5,'background':0,(0,2):1,(1,2):2,(2,2):2,(3,2):1,(4,2):2,(5,2):2,(6,2):1,(7,2):2,(8,2):2,(9,2):1,(10,2):2,(11,2):2,(12,2):1,(13,2):2,(14,2):2,(15,2):1,(0,3):2,(1,3):1,(2,3):2,(3,3):2,(4,3):1,(5,3):2,(6,3):2,(7,3):1,(8,3):2,(9,3):2,(10,3):1,(11,3):2,(12,3):2,(13,3):1,(14,3):2,(15,3):2}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[3] = {'width':9,'height':5,'background':0,(0,1):3,(1,1):1,(2,1):1,(3,1):3,(4,1):1,(5,1):1,(6,1):3,(7,1):1,(8,1):1,(0,2):3,(1,2):1,(2,2):1,(3,2):3,(4,2):1,(5,2):1,(6,2):3,(7,2):1,(8,2):1}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[3] = PREDICT
```

# Task A
The pattern seems to involve doubling the width of the image while keeping the height constant. The pixel values and their positions are also being replicated in the extended part of the image.

# Task B

| Observation Name      | Observation Values     | Comments about the Observation |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Width Increase        | Double                 | The width of the output is double the input. |
| Height Change         | No change              | The height of the image stays the same. |
| Pixel Value Replication| Yes                    | The pixel values are replicated in the output. |
| Pixel Position Replication| Yes                  | The pixel positions are also replicated in the extended part of the output. |
| Shapes                | Horizontal lines       | The pixels form horizontal lines, extending edge to edge. |
| Other Shapes          | No                     | No other shapes like rectangles, L-shapes, T-shapes, E-shapes, etc. are observed. |
| Connected Clusters    | Yes                    | The pixels seem to form connected clusters, representing horizontal lines. |
| Layer Change          | No                     | No layer changes are observed. |
| Mass                  | Same                   | The mass of each layer remains the same, just duplicated. |
| Boolean Operations    | No                     | No boolean operations like xor, and, or, seem to be happening. |
| Tiny Object Change Layer | No                  | There are no tiny objects changing layer. |
| Object Movement       | No                     | No objects seem to be moving relative x,y. |

# Task C
The transformation seems to involve doubling the width of the image while keeping the height constant. The pixel values and their positions are replicated in the extended part of the output image. This results in two identical halves of the output image.

# Task D

Based on the observations, the output should be a width-doubled version of the input, with pixel values and positions replicated in the second half. 

```python
output[3] = {'width':18,'height':5,'background':0,
             (0,1):3,(1,1):1,(2,1):1,(3,1):3,(4,1):1,(5,1):1,(6,1):3,(7,1):1,(8,1):1,
             (9,1):3,(10,1):1,(11,1):1,(12,1):3,(13,1):1,(14,1):1,(15,1):3,(16,1):1,(17,1):1,
             (0,2):3,(1,2):1,(2,2):1,(3,2):3,(4,2):1,(5,2):1,(6,2):3,(7,2):1,(8,2):1,
             (9,2):3,(10,2):1,(11,2):1,(12,2):3,(13,2):1,(14,2):1,(15,2):3,(16,2):1,(17,2):1}
```
