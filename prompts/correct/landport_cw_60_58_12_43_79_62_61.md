## Subtask C

# Task

This task is completed when the subtasks have been completed.

Fill in your answer into the `Answer Template`.

## Subtask A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common, like abstraction and reasoning. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

## Subtask B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation E - Output`.

## Subtask C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

## Subtask A: Analysis

The transformation seems to be swapping the first two elements of each row in the input PGM image. This can be observed by comparing the first elements of the output rows with those of the input rows. The width and height of a PGM image are given as the first two numbers in the header line, so they do not change during this transformation.

## Subtask B: Solution

To compute the output for `Transformation E - Input`, we need to apply the same rule as in the previous transformations. This means swapping the first two elements of each row. So, the output would be:

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
9 7
```

## Subtask C: Verify

By checking the input and output against each other, we can confirm that the transformation was applied correctly. The first elements of each row in the output are indeed swapped with the second elements from the corresponding rows in the input.

Correct!
