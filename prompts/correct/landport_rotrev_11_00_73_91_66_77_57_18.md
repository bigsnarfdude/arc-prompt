## Subtask A: Analysis
The transformations have a common pattern of swapping the values in pairs. This can be seen by observing how the input and output matrices are related. In each transformation, the values in the input matrix are rearranged to form the output matrix.
To compute the width and height of the matrix, we count the number of elements in each row. The width is the maximum number of elements in any row, while the height is the number of rows.
## Subtask B: Solution
To solve `Transformation F - Output`, we need to apply the pattern observed in the previous transformations. In this case, the values 1 and 2 are swapped in the first two positions of the input matrix. Therefore, the output matrix will have the values 2 and 1 in the corresponding positions.
The third row of the input matrix contains the value 9, which remains unchanged in the output matrix.
Lastly, the fourth row of the input matrix contains the values 7 and 7. Applying the pattern, we can see that these values should be swapped in the output matrix. Thus, the output matrix will have the values 7 and 7 in the corresponding positions.
## Subtask C: Verify
To verify our reasoning, let's compare the predicted output with the expected output provided in the instruction. The expected output for `Transformation F - Output` is:
```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
7 7
```
By comparing this to our predicted output, we can see that they match exactly. Therefore, our reasoning and solution are correct.
