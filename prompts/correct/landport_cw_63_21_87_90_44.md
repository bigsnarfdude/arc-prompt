## Subtask A: Analysis

The transformations involve reshaping the input PGM (Portable Graymap) image data into different formats based on their dimensions. The first number in the PGM header represents the number of columns, and the second number represents the number of rows. Transformations A and B decrease the number of rows while keeping the number of columns constant. Transformation C decreases the number of columns while increasing the number of rows to maintain the total number of pixels. Transformations D change both dimensions by swapping their order.

To compute the width (columns) and height (rows), simply read the first two numbers in the PGM header.

## Subtask B: Solution

For Transformation E - Input, the number of columns is 1, and the number of rows is 2. To apply Transformation C to this input, we need to decrease the number of columns (width) and increase the number of rows (height). So, the output will have a width of 2 and a height of 1.

## Subtask C: Verify

The analysis and solution are correct. The transformation rules state that Transformation C decreases the number of columns while increasing the number of rows to maintain the total number of pixels. In this case, we start with one column and two rows, which corresponds to a total of 2 pixels. To decrease the number of columns (width) from 1 to 2, we need to increase the number of rows (height) accordingly. Therefore, the output should have a width of 2 and a height of 1.

## Subtask E: Output

```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
4 4
