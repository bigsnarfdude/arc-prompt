I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(0,0):8,(1,0):8,(0,1):8,(1,1):8}
output[0] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(0,1):2,(1,1):2,(0,2):2,(1,2):2}

input[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(1,0):8}
output[1] = {'width':3,'height':3,'background':0,(1,1):2}

input[2] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(1,1):8,(2,1):8,(3,1):8}
output[2] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(1,2):2,(2,2):2,(3,2):2}
```

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[3] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(2,0):8,(1,1):8,(2,1):8,(2,2):8}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[3] = PREDICT
```

# Task A

The main pattern observed is that the coordinates with value 8 in the input images get moved one step down and their values are changed to 2 in the output images. There's no change in the width, height, and background of the images.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layer Mass | 1 for all layers | Each layer contains only one type of pixel, with value 8 in input and 2 in output |
| Strongly Connected Clusters | 1 in all cases | All 8-valued pixels are connected in the input images |
| Mass and Layer Sorting | No | There's no sorting of layers, only transformation of pixel values |
| Isolated Pixels | Absent | All 8-valued pixels are connected |
| Horizontal Lines | No | No horizontal lines observed |
| Vertical Lines | No | No vertical lines observed |
| Filled Rectangles | No | No filled rectangles observed |
| Hollow Boxes | No | No hollow boxes observed |
| L-Shapes | No | No L-shapes observed |
| T-Shapes | No | No T-shapes observed |
| H-Shapes | No | No H-shapes observed |
| E-Shapes | No | No E-shapes observed |
| Plus-Shapes | No | No Plus-shapes observed |
| Tetris-Shapes | No | No Tetris-shapes observed |
| Other Shapes | Yes | Single pixel movement and value transformation observed |
| Shape Change Layer | No | Shapes are not preserved, they are transformed |
| Shape Move | Yes | Single step downward movement |
| Boolean Operations | No | No Boolean operations observed |

# Task C

The main action that converts the input to output is shifting the pixels with the value 8 one step downward and changing their values to 2.

# Task D

From the previous patterns, we can see that the pixels with the value 8 will be shifted one step downward and their values will be changed to 2. Hence, for the given input the output should be:

```python
output[3] = {'width':5,'height':5,'background':0,(2,1):2,(1,2):2,(2,2):2,(2,3):2}
```
