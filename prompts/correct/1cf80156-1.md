I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.
```prolog
% Example 1 input grid_width12_height10
object(input1_idPfe7a8k_t3_l4_b6_r7_w4_h4_m9_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot270)).

% Example 1 output grid_width4_height4
object(output1_idPfe7a8k_t1_l1_b4_r4_w4_h4_m9_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(rot270)).

% Example 2 input grid_width12_height11
object(input2_idP3d53ef_t2_l3_b6_r5_w3_h5_m8_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(flip90)).

% Example 2 output grid_width3_height5
object(output2_idP3d53ef_t1_l1_b5_r3_w3_h5_m8_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(flip90)).

% Example 3 input grid_width12_height12
object(input3_idPz7ea0g_t4_l4_b6_r8_w5_h3_m8_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(flip)).

% Example 3 output grid_width5_height3
object(output3_idPz7ea0g_t1_l1_b3_r5_w5_h3_m8_shapeUnclassified_scalex1_scaley1, transform(flip)).
```


There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Consider the touch point may be at the center of another object, so objects can be moved to the center point.
Check how many times an object is duplicated, does it correspond to the mass of another object or some other property.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, copy, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width12_height12
object(input4_idP48kmo7_t5_l3_b8_r8_w6_h4_m11_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(rot0)).

% Example 4 output grid_width6_height4
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output4_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A

After a thorough analysis of the provided examples, it can be observed that in each case:

1. The objects in the output grids preserve the `id`, `m` (mass), `w` (width), `h` (height), `shape` and `scale` attributes from the corresponding objects in the input grids.
2. The coordinates of the objects in the output grids are reset to be as top-left as possible, i.e., each object occupies the grid from top (t=1) and left (l=1) to bottom (b=height) and right (r=width). This suggests that the objects are moved to the top-left corner of the grid.
3. No new objects are inserted, no existing objects are deleted, and there is no sorting of objects based on any attribute in the output grid. The transformation merely involves moving and reorienting the object while maintaining its properties.

# Task B

Considering the given examples, the transformations performed on the objects from the input grid to the output grid can be explained as follows:

1. Resetting coordinates: The objects are moved such that they occupy the grid from top (t=1) and left (l=1) to bottom (b=height) and right (r=width).
2. Preserving properties: The `id`, `m` (mass), `w` (width), `h` (height), `shape` and `scale` attributes of the objects remain unchanged.
3. No Insertion/Deletion: There are no new objects inserted, and no existing objects are deleted in the output grid.

Reasoning for not inserting new objects: There seems to be no rule in the given examples that would require inserting new objects in the output grid.

Reasoning for not deleting existing objects: All the objects in the input grids have a corresponding object in the output grids with the same properties, thus no deletion of existing objects is required.

# Task C

Based on the given examples, the orientation of the objects in the output grids is such that each object occupies the grid from top (t=1) and left (l=1) to bottom (b=height) and right (r=width). This suggests that the objects are reoriented such that they are moved to the top-left corner of the grid. As a result, it would not make sense to layout the objects in another direction.

# Task D

The same pattern as in previous examples is expected to follow for the 4th example. So, the properties of the object including `id`, `m` (mass), `w` (width), `h` (height), `shape` and `scale` will be preserved, while its position will be reset to start from the top-left corner of the grid.

Hence, the expected output for the 4th example would be:

```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width6_height4
object(output4_idP48kmo7_t1_l1_b4_r6_w6_h4_m11_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(rot0)).
```

The object in the output maintains the same properties as in the input, but its coordinates are updated to occupy the grid from top (t=1) and left (l=1) to bottom (b=height) and right (r=width), aligning with the patterns observed in the provided examples.
