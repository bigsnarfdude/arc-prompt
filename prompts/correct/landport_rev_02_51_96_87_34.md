# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation C - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A, B, and C, the input PGM files have a fixed width of 2 columns (P2) and an unknown height. The transformation swaps the order of the numbers in each row, except for the first row which remains unchanged.

To compute the height, we count the number of rows in the input file. In this case, it is determined by finding the last non-zero value.

For Transformation C - Output, the solution would be:
```pgm
P2
# output
2 1
9
6 9
```

Correct!
