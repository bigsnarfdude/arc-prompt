# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A, B, and C, the input PGM file has two rows of data: a header row with width and height information, followed by a list of pixel values. The transformation changes the order of the pixel values in the second row while keeping the width and height unchanged.

To compute width and height from the header row, we read the first two numbers as width and height respectively. For example, in Transformation A, the width is 2 and the height is 1.

For Transformation D - Output, the output should be:
```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
9
7
```

Correct!
