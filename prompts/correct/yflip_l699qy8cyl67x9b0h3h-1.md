I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.
```prolog
% Example 1 input grid_width5_height5
object(input1_idP48kmo7_t2_l3_b4_r5_w3_h3_m9_shapeRectangle_scalex3_scaley3, transform(all)).

% Example 1 output grid_width5_height5
object(output1_idP48kmo7_t2_l1_b4_r3_w3_h3_m9_shapeRectangle_scalex3_scaley3, transform(all)).

% Example 2 input grid_width5_height5
object(input2_idP48kmo7_t1_l2_b5_r5_w4_h5_m14_shapeU5_scaleUnknown, transform(rot90_flip270)).

% Example 2 output grid_width5_height5
object(output2_idP48kmo7_t1_l1_b5_r4_w4_h5_m14_shapeU5_scaleUnknown, transform(rot270_flip90)).

% Example 3 input grid_width5_height5
object(input3_idPj8kdf4_t1_l1_b5_r5_w5_h5_m9_shapeL_scaleUnknown, transform(rot270_flip180)).

% Example 3 output grid_width5_height5
object(output3_idPj8kdf4_t1_l1_b5_r5_w5_h5_m9_shapeL_scaleUnknown, transform(rot180_flip270)).
```


There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Consider the touch point may be at the center of another object, so objects can be moved to the center point.
Check how many times an object is duplicated, does it correspond to the mass of another object or some other property.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, copy, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width5_height5
object(input4_idP847fa3_t2_l1_b4_r5_w5_h3_m11_shapeU5_scaleUnknown, transform(rot90_flip270)).

% Example 4 output grid_width5_height5
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output4_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A

Observing the example outputs, here are some key takeaways:

1. Object shapes are maintained: The shape of the objects remains the same in all the examples.

2. Bounding boxes are unchanged: The width (w) and height (h) of the objects remain the same, indicating that the objects' bounding boxes haven't changed.

3. Mass is preserved: The mass (m) of the objects in the output is the same as the mass of the corresponding objects in the input. This indicates that no solid pixels were added or removed during the transformations.

4. Rotation and flip transformations are reversed: Each object's transformation in the output is the reverse of its transformation in the input. For example, a `rot90_flip270` transform in the input becomes a `rot270_flip90` transform in the output.

5. Object movement: The objects appear to move to the left from their original positions. This movement is indicated by the difference in 'l' and 'r' (left and right coordinates of the bounding box) between input and output. The top 't' and bottom 'b' coordinates remain the same, indicating no vertical movement.

6. ID preservation: The ID of the objects remain the same in both the input and the output, meaning no new objects are introduced, and no existing objects are deleted.

# Task B

The transformation that can be inferred from all examples involves two steps:

1. Reverse the rotation and flip transformations: For each object in the input, the rotation and flip transformations applied are reversed in the output.

2. Move the objects to the left: Each object in the input seems to be shifted to the left in the output. The distance of movement can be derived from the change in the left and right coordinates of the bounding box.

No new objects are inserted in the given examples, and no existing objects are deleted. All objects from the input are present in the output, and their properties are preserved, with the exception of their position and the reverse of their transformation.

# Task C

The orientation of the output objects makes sense as they are maintaining the layout direction of the input objects. There is no change in the 't' and 'b' coordinates indicating no vertical reorientation. The horizontal movement of the objects also indicates a leftward reorientation.

If a different direction was to be considered, it would require changes in the 't' and 'b' coordinates, which is not observed in the given examples. Hence, no change in orientation seems to be required.

# Task D

Before predicting the output, let's identify the changes based on previous examples:

1. Reverse transformations: The input object has a `rot90_flip270` transform. This would be reversed in the output, leading to a `rot270_flip90` transform.

2. Horizontal movement: In the previous examples, the objects moved to the left by 1 or 2 units. Since the leftmost edge of this object is already at the boundary (`l1`), the object cannot move further to the left. Hence, the object should stay in its original position.

Therefore, the output for the given input should be:
```prolog
% Example 4 output grid_width5_height5
object(output4_idP847fa3_t2_l1_b4_r5_w5_h3_m11_shapeU5_scaleUnknown, transform(rot270_flip90)).
```
This prediction maintains the same mass, shape, and position as the input, and only changes the transformation to its reverse, as observed in the previous examples.
