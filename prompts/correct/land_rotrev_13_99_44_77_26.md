# Task A: Analysis

Think step by step, what does the transformation have in common. Use max 100 words.

Explain how to compute width and height. Use max 10 words.

# Task B: Solution

I want you to solve `Transformation D - Output`.

# Task C: Verify

Double check that your reasoning is correct and check the solution. Use max 100 words.

 In Transformations A-C, the input has a fixed width of 2 and variable height. The output has a width equal to the number of unique first elements in the input and a height equal to the maximum second element in the input.

For Transformation D, the output should have a width of 2 (as in all other transformations) and a height equal to the maximum second element in the input, which is 7. The output would be:

```pgm
P2
# output
1 2
9
7
7
```

Correct!
