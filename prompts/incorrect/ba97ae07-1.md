I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Consider the touch point may be at the center of another object, so objects can be moved to the center point.
Check how many times an object is duplicated, does it correspond to the mass of another object or some other property.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, copy, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 5 input grid_width6_height11
object(input5_idPj8kdf4_t3_l5_b4_r6_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(input5_idPj8kdf4_t3_l1_b4_r2_w2_h2_m4_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(input5_idP989a7f_t1_l3_b11_r4_w2_h11_m22_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley11, transform(all)).

% Example 5 output grid_width6_height11

```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

# Task A
For task A, I will examine the objects in the output examples and look for commonalities among them. For example, the objects could share similar properties such as shape, orientation, size, and location.

Observations:
1. Objects in the output maintain their original shape. All input objects are rectangles and they remain rectangles in the output.
2. In all examples, objects with the same ID are merged vertically or horizontally based on their placements in the input. It seems like objects with the same ID always merge regardless of their dimensions.
3. Objects are sorted based on the top coordinate (t). Smaller values of 't' are placed first. The order of the objects with the same top coordinate is determined by their left coordinate (l).
4. The total mass of objects with the same ID is preserved in the output.

# Task B
For task B, I will consider the transformations that occurred to transform the input objects into the output objects.

1. Merge: Objects with the same ID are merged. If they are stacked vertically in the input, they are merged into one long rectangle vertically. If they are placed horizontally in the input, they are merged into one wide rectangle. The width, height, and mass are updated accordingly.
2. Removal: Objects are removed if they are completely occluded by other objects in the input. We can determine this by checking if the ID of the occluded object appears in the output. If it does not, then the object is removed.
3. Insertion: No new objects are inserted. All objects in the output correspond to objects in the input.

# Task C
For task C, I will think about the orientation of the output objects.

The orientation of the objects in the output seems to be determined by their orientation in the input. For example, if two objects with the same ID are stacked vertically in the input, they merge into a taller rectangle in the output. If two objects with the same ID are placed horizontally in the input, they merge into a wider rectangle in the output.

# Task D
Given the above observations, I will now attempt to predict the output for Example 5.

1. The objects with idPj8kdf4 are aligned vertically in the input and should merge into a taller rectangle. The mass will be the sum of the two input objects (m4+m4=m8).
2. The object with idP989a7f remains unchanged as it is the only object with that ID. 

```prolog
% Example 5 output grid_width6_height11
object(output5_idPj8kdf4_t3_l1_b4_r6_w6_h2_m8_shapeRectangle_scalex6_scaley2, transform(all)).
object(output5_idP989a7f_t1_l3_b11_r4_w2_h11_m22_shapeRectangle_scalex2_scaley11, transform(all)).
```

Nitpick, I have no z-indexes to keep track of the drawing order.
