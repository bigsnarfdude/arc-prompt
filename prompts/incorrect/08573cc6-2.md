I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.

The number of solid pixels in the object has a 'm' prefix, like 'm12' is mass=12.

The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered for sorting. The number of unique IDs may be relevant. The total mass of certain IDs is sometimes preserved in the output.

There number of output objects can be different than the input objects. Also consider the rules with clockwise rotation.
Check if a condition is satisfied only for objects with a certain shape.
A shape can occlude another shape, so shapeL may appear as shapeRectangle. Sometimes it's the occluded object that gets transformed.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects.
Check how much an object moves relative x, y.
Check how IDs gets swapped. Don't invent new IDs.
Objects that stay stationary may be a useful landmark. A landmark may be a starting point for inserting a new object next to. Check that the examples have landmarks.


Check if objects are aligned to a certain edge. Check if the mass is preserved. Count the number of object groups.
Check if all the output objects agree on the same shape.
Check if the shape may be a shortest path drawn between two landmarks and navigates around obstacle objects.
For the objects that make it to the output, check if their shape is preserved.
A line that goes from edge to edge, some condition may be satisfied above the line, but not below it.
Consider where two objects are touching, maybe the touch points are different in the output, such as moving from left side to the opposite side.
Consider the touch point may be at the center of another object, so objects can be moved to the center point.
Check how many times an object is duplicated, does it correspond to the mass of another object or some other property.
Transformations: sort, gravity towards, rotate, flipx, flipy, move, copy, merge objects, split objects, extract object, fit object inside another object, layout 2..5 objects in a direction while keeping the objects aligned and evenly spaced (remember to update tlbr coordinates). The transformation can be anything, it just have to be simple.


# Task A
Think step by step, what does the examples output objects have in common. Check if they are all horizontal lines. Are they sorted in a particular way.


# Task B
Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Write down your observations.
Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
Explain your reasoning for deleting existing objects.


# Task C
Think step by step about the orientation of the output objects. Does it make sense to layout the objects in another direction. Update the object coordinates accordingly.


# Task D
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be. Print your reasoning before the prolog code.


```prolog
% Example 4 input grid_width13_height13

Breaking down the task

Analyzing Prolog code examples, identifying transformations, and predicting the output for Example 4. This involves understanding patterns and systematically applying reasoning to anticipated results.

Examining transformations

I’m evaluating object properties in Example 1’s input and output grids, including transformations and scaling, to draw insights for understanding the process.

Breaking down transformations

Examining output patterns

I’m analyzing the output objects in the examples, noting that certain objects consistently remain unchanged, while others transform into multiple different objects with varying sizes and positions. This suggests a selective transformation process.

Assessing transformations, I observe idP48kmo7 changes to two objects, idPj8kdf4 to three, and idP3d53ef remains static. Let's explore the patterns and implications.

Determining transformation patterns

I’m thinking through how specific IDs, like idPj8kdf4 and idP33ffe7, are transformed into multiple horizontal and vertical lines. For instance, idP3d53ef remains static, likely representing obstacles.

Examining shape patterns

Hm, I’m thinking about how idPj8kdf4 forms multiple horizontal lines and idP48kmo7 creates vertical lines. This pattern continues in other examples, with specific IDs aligning with distinct shapes or transformations.

Assessing occlusion and shape transformation

I'm examining how one shape, like shapeL, can obscure another, such as shapeRectangle. Considering Euclidean and Manhattan distances, I'm thinking about objects' relative movement and ID swaps.

Mapping out transformations

I'm considering a line that runs edge-to-edge, influencing conditions above or below it. This idea leads me to think about object interactions and movements, and how transforming objects like sorting, rotating, or merging, can create various outcomes.

Analyzing the progression

I'm analyzing Task B to Task D, focusing on transformations, reasoning for object additions or deletions, and evaluating object orientation and coordinates.

Investigating mass patterns

I observed that certain IDs in the input result in multiple objects in the output, with their masses exceeding the input. This suggests a pattern between input and output mass transformation.

Weighing the options

I’m thinking about how the masses of the output objects might relate to the lines. Each object's mass equals its length, which helps us understand the total mass.

Tracking object transition

I'm mapping out how initial objects' positions affect the masses and sizes of new objects. The coordinates shift similarly to the masses and sizes.

Tracking progress

OK, let’s see. The initial positions and extracted data from idPj8kdf4 and idP48kmo7 are noted, with inconsistencies and an assessment of potential patterns forming digits in the output.

Evaluating digit patterns

I'm examining the digit formations with the output shapes of idPj8kdf4 and idP48kmo7. It seems like idPj8kdf4 outlines horizontal lines, while idP48kmo7 sketches vertical lines, hinting at digit '3' and '5'.

Identifying patterns

I’m exploring if the output forms the digit IDs. For instance, idPj8kdf4 forms '3', idP48kmo7 forms '5'. This consistent pattern might suggest a link.

Mapping connections

Taking a closer look at the provided IDs, it's interesting to see they have embedded digits. These digits might be crucial for identifying connections or patterns, but so far, it seems this approach hasn't been helpful.

Mapping ID associations

I'm focusing on the ID outputs forming digits. For Example 4, idP3d53ef remains unchanged, while idPz7ea0g is likely generating lines to form '7'.

Analyzing line orientation

I'm evaluating ways to draw '7' using only horizontal and vertical lines. For idPz7ea0g, this means drawing horizontal lines, while for idPfe7a8k, it suggests vertical lines. This approach ensures the design adheres to the constraints specified.

Mapping out positions

I’m digging into the idea that the positions of horizontal and vertical lines shape the digits. It’s interesting to see how these alignments might create specific numbers.

Analyzing patterns

I’m gathering info on the total masses of outputs for various IDs. These masses could represent digits or ASCII codes. Further examination of these patterns is warranted.

Exploring possibilities

I’m thinking about different ways to form grid lines using lines and dots. Horizontal lines help create '7', and vertical lines can form '1'. This method is worth further exploration.

Generating schematic patterns

OK, let's break this down. For idPz7ea0g, generating horizontal lines positions like idPj8kdf4’s outputs. For idPfe7a8k, using vertical lines positions similar to idP33ffe7’s outputs.

Mapping out patterns

I'm examining how to align horizontal and vertical lines with the grid size, drawing insights from previous examples to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Analyzing prediction patterns

I'm analyzing the output for Example 4 by examining the three horizontal lines for idPz7ea0g, three vertical lines for idPfe7a8k, and no changes for idP3d53ef.

Aligning examples

I’m aligning the outputs for Example 4 with previous ones, ensuring transformations for consistent IDs like idPz7ea0g and idPfe7a8k are similar to previous examples, adjusting as needed.

Predicting outputs

I'm predicting that idPz7ea0g will produce horizontal lines like idPj8kdf4 and idPfe7a8k will produce vertical lines similar to idP48kmo7.

To predict the output for Example 4, we need to analyze the transformations observed in the previous examples and apply them accordingly.

**Observation from Examples 1-3:**

1. **Consistent Transformation Based on IDs:**
   - Objects with certain IDs are transformed into multiple horizontal or vertical lines.
   - The object with `idP3d53ef` remains unchanged across all examples.
   - Objects with IDs like `idPj8kdf4` and `idPz7ea0g` are transformed into horizontal lines.
   - Objects with IDs like `idPfe7a8k` and `idP48kmo7` are transformed into vertical lines.

2. **Positioning and Scaling:**
   - The new lines are positioned to form patterns resembling digits or letters.
   - The scaling factors (`scalex` and `scaley`) correspond to the length of the lines.
   - The starting positions and lengths are adjusted based on the grid size.

**Applying Observations to Example 4:**

- **`idPz7ea0g` Transformation:**
  - Since `idPz7ea0g` is similar to `idPj8kdf4` in previous examples, we transform it into horizontal lines.
  - We create horizontal lines at different rows (`t` values) with varying lengths (`w` and `m` values).

- **`idPfe7a8k` Transformation:**
  - Following its pattern from previous examples, `idPfe7a8k` is transformed into vertical lines.
  - We place vertical lines at different columns (`l` values) with varying heights (`h` and `m` values).

- **`idP3d53ef` Remains Unchanged:**
  - As in previous examples, this object stays the same in the output.

**Predicted Output for Example 4:**

```prolog
