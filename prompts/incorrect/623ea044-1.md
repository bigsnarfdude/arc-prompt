I'm doing CPP experiments.


These are run-length encoded images.
The RLE used here only uses black and white. There are no other colors than black or white. Example `3B7W2B` becomes `3 black, 7 white, 2 black`.

The ID indicates the layer number. Multiple images can be stacked and black can be considered transparent.


```cpp
input[0] = "width15:height15:ID0:15W 15W 15W 3W1B11W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W 15W:ID2:15B 15B 15B 3B1W11B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B 15B";

# Task A
Use at most 50 words.
Think step by step.
- Decode the RLE images to your internal visualization. Take care that the number of Bs and number of Ws sums to the width parameter.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain integers, IDs, yes/no, shape names, absent, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there shapes such as boxes, L-shape, H-shape, E-shape, Plus-shape, Tetris shapes.
- Are there a line connecting two landmarks.
- Does shape move between layer IDs.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```cpp
input[3] = "width17:height17:ID0:17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 12W1B4W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W 17W:ID6:17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 12B1W4B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B 17B";
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```cpp
output[3] = "width17:height17:PREDICT";
```

# Task A

Decoding the RLE images, it's clear that the inputs represent different patterns. 

For the first input, there is a vertical line in the middle for both ID0 and ID2. 

The second input also has a vertical line but positioned a little to the right for both ID0 and ID7.

The third input again has a central vertical line for both ID0 and ID8. 

In each case, the output images appear to have been manipulated into a diamond-like pattern for both IDs.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mass of Each Layer | Equal in Input and Output | Both layers of input and output images have the same mass. |
| Strongly Connected Clusters | 1 in Each Layer | There is one strongly connected cluster in each layer of both input and output images. |
| Mass Relation to Layers | Not Apparent | No clear relationship between mass and layer ordering is observed. |
| Horizontal Lines | Yes, Edge-to-Edge | Horizontal lines are present in both input and output images. |
| Vertical Lines | Input: Yes, Not Edge-to-Edge; Output: No | Vertical lines are present in the input but not in the output. |
| Shapes | Boxes in Input, Diamond in Output | The input images have a box-like shape, while the output images have a diamond-like shape. |
| Line Connecting Landmarks | Not Apparent | No line connecting landmarks observed. |
| Shape Movement between IDs | No | The shapes do not move between different layer IDs. |
| Shape Movement relative x,y | No | The shapes do not move in terms of relative positions. |
| Boolean Operations | Possible XOR | An XOR operation might be applied, since black and white are exchanged in the output.

# Task C

The actions that convert the input to the output can be summarized as follows: 
- Each white or black pixel in the input image is replaced with a diamond shape that spreads outwards, retaining the color of the original pixel.
- This operation is performed on every pixel, creating the final diamond pattern in the output image.

# Task D

Given the patterns observed in the previous examples, it's likely the vertical line in the input will be transformed into a diamond shape in the output for both IDs. The vertical line appears to be near the center, but slightly to the right. 

```cpp
output[3] = "width17:height17:ID0:8W1B8W 9W1B7W 10W1B5W1B 11W1B3W1B1W 12W1B1W1B2W 13W1B3W 12W1B1W1B2W 11W1B3W1B1W 10W1B5W1B 9W1B7W 8W1B8W 7W1B9W 6W1B10W 5W1B11W 4W1B12W 3W1B13W 2W1B14W:ID6:8B1W8B 9B1W7B 10B1W5B1W 11B1W3B1W1B 12B1W1B1W2B 13B1W3B 12B1W1B1W2B 11B1W3B1W1B 10B1W5B1W 9B1W7B 8B1W8B 7B1W9B 6B1W10B 5B1W11B 4B1W12B 3B1W13B 2B1W14B";
```

One of the diagonals is off by 1 pixel.
