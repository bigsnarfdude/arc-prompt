I'm doing Python experiments.


These are images.


```python
input = {}
output = {}
input[0] = {'width':10,'height':12,'background':0,(4,3):2,(3,4):2,(4,4):2,(5,4):2,(4,5):2}
output[0] = {'width':10,'height':12,'background':0,(0,0):1,(4,0):4,(8,0):1,(1,1):1,(4,1):8,(7,1):1,(2,2):1,(4,2):8,(6,2):1,(3,3):1,(4,3):2,(5,3):1,(0,4):4,(1,4):8,(2,4):8,(3,4):2,(4,4):2,(5,4):2,(6,4):8,(7,4):8,(8,4):4,(9,4):8,(3,5):1,(4,5):2,(5,5):1,(2,6):1,(4,6):8,(6,6):1,(1,7):1,(4,7):8,(7,7):1,(0,8):1,(4,8):4,(8,8):1,(4,9):8,(9,9):1,(4,10):8,(4,11):4}

input[1] = {'width':16,'height':7,'background':0,(3,2):2,(2,3):2,(3,3):2,(4,3):2,(3,4):2}
output[1] = {'width':16,'height':7,'background':0,(0,0):1,(3,0):8,(6,0):1,(1,1):1,(3,1):8,(5,1):1,(2,2):1,(3,2):2,(4,2):1,(0,3):8,(1,3):8,(2,3):2,(3,3):2,(4,3):2,(5,3):8,(6,3):8,(7,3):4,(8,3):8,(9,3):8,(10,3):4,(11,3):8,(12,3):8,(13,3):4,(14,3):8,(15,3):8,(2,4):1,(3,4):2,(4,4):1,(1,5):1,(3,5):8,(5,5):1,(0,6):1,(3,6):8,(6,6):1}
```

# Task A
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
- Write notes about what shapes and patterns you observe.
- The output is never the same as the input.
- Is the output a cropped out area from the input.
- Is the output similar to the input rotated.
- Is the output similar to the input flipped.
- Is the output similar to the input diagonally flipped.
- Are the output images symmetric around the x-axis, y-axis or both.
- Are pixels gravitating towards one of the edges: top, bottom, left, right.


# Task B
Use at most 300 words.
Include a markdown formatted table with the most important observations about input and output images.
The table has three columns: observation name, observation values, comments about the observation.
The `observation values` column can contain: integers, Yes, No, Absent, IDs, shape names, decreasing order, and so on.
Think step by step.
- Count the mass of each layer.
- Count how many strongly connected clusters there are inside each layer.
- Is mass related to the sorting of layers.
- Isolated pixels without an adjacent pixel of same layer, sometimes they change layer.
- Are there horizontal lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there vertical lines, do they extend edge to edge.
- Are there stripes with evenly spaced lines.
- Are there filled rectangles.
- Are there hollow boxes.
- Are there L-shapes.
- Are there T-shapes.
- Are there H-shapes.
- Are there E-shapes.
- Are there Plus-shapes.
- Are there Tetris-shapes.
- Are there other shapes.
- Does the output contain a tile that is being used a few times. Is that tile identical to the input image.
- What shapes are there with holes, such as boxes, where the hole is separated from the outside.
- What shapes are there where the border has small holes, such as a box with 1 pixel missing in the border, so it's no longer a hole.
- Is there a line connecting two landmarks, is it the shortest path.
- Does shape change layer, but preserves their shape, and what may be triggering it.
- Does shape move relative x,y.
- Boolean operations may happen: xor, and, or.
- Does a tiny object change layer, because it's nearest to a bigger object in that layer.


# Task C
Use at most 100 words.
Think step by step.
What are the actions that converts input to output.


# Task D
With the following example input, I want you to predict what the output should be.


```python
input[2] = {'width':17,'height':30,'background':0,(7,10):2,(6,11):2,(7,11):2,(8,11):2,(7,12):2}
```
Print your reasoning before printing the code.
Don't print other markdown code blocks than the code block containing your predictions.


Fill your predictions into the following template and replace PREDICT with your predictions.
```python
output[2] = PREDICT
```

# Task A

- In both examples, the input images have a '+' shaped pattern made of 2's at the center. 
- The output images are not the same as the input. They have more complexities, patterns, and numbers other than 2's and 0's.
- The output images are not cropped areas from the input.
- The output images are not rotated versions of the input.
- The output images are not flipped versions of the input. 
- The output images are not diagonally flipped versions of the input.
- The output images don't seem to be symmetric around either the x-axis or y-axis.
- Pixels don't appear to be gravitating towards any particular edge.

# Task B

| Observation Name | Observation Values | Comments about the Observation |
|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Mass of Each Layer | Variable | It appears that the number of pixels in each layer varies in output images. |
| Strongly Connected Clusters | Yes | There are clusters in the output, notably around the original '+' shape in the input. |
| Layer Sorting and Mass | No | The mass does not seem to affect the sorting of layers. |
| Isolated Pixels | Yes | Some isolated pixels change layer in the output. |
| Horizontal Lines | Yes | There are horizontal lines that do not extend edge to edge. |
| Vertical Lines | Yes | There are vertical lines that do not extend edge to edge. |
| Evenly Spaced Stripes | No | No clear patterns of evenly spaced stripes observed. |
| Filled Rectangles | Yes | Filled rectangles can be observed around the '+' shape in the input. |
| Hollow Boxes | No | No hollow boxes observed. |
| L-Shapes | No | No L-shapes observed. |
| T-Shapes | No | No T-shapes observed. |
| H-Shapes | No | No H-Shapes observed. |
| E-Shapes | No | No E-shapes observed. |
| Plus-Shapes | Yes | Plus shape from the input is maintained in output. |
| Tetris-Shapes | No | No Tetris shapes observed. |
| Other Shapes | Yes | Various irregular shapes are observed. |
| Tile Replication | No | No exact replication of the input as a tile in the output. |
| Shapes with Holes | No | No shapes with holes observed. |
| Border Holes | No | No shapes with border holes observed. |
| Line Connections | No | No line connections observed. |
| Layer Preserving Shape Change | Yes | Some pixels change layer but maintain their relative position. |
| Shape Movements | Yes | The '+' shape moves relative x, y in the output. |
| Boolean Operations | No | No clear evidence of boolean operations. |
| Tiny Object Layer Change | No | No tiny objects change layer due to proximity to larger objects. |

# Task C

- The '+' shape in the input image is preserved in the output.
- Certain additional patterns are generated around the '+' shape.
- The numbers are updated from 2's to other numbers in the output based on certain unknown rules.
- The width and height are preserved in the output.

# Task D

Reasoning: By following the pattern in the previous examples, the '+' shape at the center would remain, surrounded by a series of patterns, which may contain numbers other than 2's. 

```python
output[2] = {'width':17,'height':30,'background':0,(0,0):1,(7,0):4,(14,0):1,(1,1):1,(7,1):8,(13,1):1,(2,2):1,(7,2):8,(12,2):1,(3,3):1,(7,3):8,(11,3):1,(4,4):1,(7,4):8,(10,4):1,(5,5):1,(7,5):8,(9,5):1,(6,6):1,(7,6):2,(8,6):1,(0,7):4,(1,7):8,(2,7):8,(3,7):8,(4,7):8,(5,7):8,(6,7):2,(7,7):2,(8,7):2,(9,7):8,(10,7):8,(11,7):8,(12,7):8,(13,7):8,(14,7):4,(15,7):8,(16,7):4,(6,8):1,(7,8):2,(8,8):1,(5,9):1,(7,9):8,(9,9):1,(4,10):1,(7,10):8,(10,10):1,(3,11):1,(7,11):8,(11,11):1,(2,12):1,(7,12):8,(12,12):1,(1,13):1,(7,13):8,(13,13):1,(0,14):1,(7,14):4,(14,14):1,(7,15):8,(7,16):8,(7,17):8,(7,18):8,(7,19):8,(7,20):8,(7,21):8,(7,22):8,(7,23):8,(7,24):8,(7,25):8,(7,26):8,(7,27):8,(7,28):8,(7,29):4}
```

Doesn't continue the diagonal lines all the way to the edges. Doesn't do the spacing correct with the yellow pixels. Otherwise very similar to the expected result.
