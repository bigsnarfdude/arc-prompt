I'm doing Prolog experiments.


The grid is 1-indexed.


Top-Left Bottom-Right (TLBR) is used for object bounding boxes, like tY_lX_bY_rX where t=top l=left b=bottom r=right.


The width of the object bounding box has a 'w' prefix, like 'w5' is width=5.
The height of the object bounding box has a 'h' prefix, like 'h3' is height=3.


The `id` prefixed text has no integer value and should not be considered.
Consider both euclidian distance and manhatten distance between objects, since it may impact the `id` assigned to the object.


```prolog
% Example 1 input grid_width13_height13
object(input1_idPfe7a8k_t10_l9_b10_r9_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input1_idPfe7a8k_t4_l4_b4_r4_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

% Example 1 output grid_width13_height13
object(output1_idPfe7a8k_t1_l1_b13_r13_w13_h13_mass48_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(all)).
object(output1_idP3d53ef_t5_l5_b9_r8_w4_h5_mass20_shapeRectangle_scalex4_scaley5, transform(all)).

% Example 2 input grid_width13_height13
object(input2_idPfe7a8k_t9_l11_b9_r11_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input2_idPfe7a8k_t5_l3_b5_r3_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

% Example 2 output grid_width13_height13
object(output2_idPfe7a8k_t1_l1_b13_r13_w13_h13_mass48_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(all)).
object(output2_idP3d53ef_t6_l4_b8_r10_w7_h3_mass21_shapeRectangle_scalex7_scaley3, transform(all)).
```
There number of output objects may be different than the input objects.
The output objects may have to be sorted by coordinates or mass or some other property.


Think step by step, what are the transformations across all the examples, that goes from the input to the output. Explain your reasoning for inserting new objects.
With the following example, I want you to predict what the output should be


```prolog
% Example 3 input grid_width13_height13
object(input3_idPfe7a8k_t11_l10_b11_r10_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input3_idPfe7a8k_t2_l5_b2_r5_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

% Example 3 output grid_width13_height13
PREDICT the text that starts with object(output3_
```
Repeat the previous example prolog code, with PREDICT replaced with your predictions.

To predict the output, we first need to understand the transformations that are occurring from the input to the output.

Observing the given examples, it seems the transformation follows these patterns:

1. An object with id `idPfe7a8k` is always present in the output, taking up the whole grid, from the top left (1,1) to the bottom right (13,13), with width and height of 13, and an unclassified shape. The mass of the object equals to the total width and height of the grid (13 * 13 = 169), but in the given examples, it's always 48. This might be a fixed value for this object, regardless of the grid size.

2. A new object is formed with `idP3d53ef` based on the position and size of the objects in the input. This object's top coordinate is the smallest top coordinate in the input plus 1, and its left coordinate is the smallest left coordinate in the input plus 1. Its bottom coordinate is the largest bottom coordinate in the input minus 1, and its right coordinate is the largest right coordinate in the input minus 1. Its width is the difference between its right and left coordinates plus 1, and its height is the difference between its bottom and top coordinates plus 1. The mass is the product of the width and the height.

3. If multiple input objects share the same id, it appears that the object is transformed based on their minimum and maximum top, left, bottom, and right coordinates.

Applying these transformations to the provided input, we can predict the output as follows:

```prolog
% Example 3 input grid_width13_height13
object(input3_idPfe7a8k_t11_l10_b11_r10_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).
object(input3_idPfe7a8k_t2_l5_b2_r5_w1_h1_mass1_shapeRectangle_scalex1_scaley1, transform(all)).

% Example 3 output grid_width13_height13
object(output3_idPfe7a8k_t1_l1_b13_r13_w13_h13_mass48_shapeUnclassified_scaleUnknown, transform(all)).
object(output3_idP3d53ef_t3_l6_b10_r9_w4_h8_mass32_shapeRectangle_scalex4_scaley8, transform(all)).
```
The transformations follow the patterns identified from the first two examples and are applied to the third example's input to generate the predicted output.
